## 1.1 Switched Campus 

### 1.1.a Switch administration
#### 1.1.a i Managing MAC address table
* `show mac address-table`
  * `aging-time`
  * `count`
  * `dynamic`
  * `interface`
  * `static`
  * `vlan`
* `clear mac address-table dynamic`
#### 1.1.a ii Errdisable recovery
* Errdisable detects errors, and will shutdown the port
  * Detection is enabled for all causes. All causes, except per-VLAN error disabling, are configured to shut down the entire port. 
* Errdisable recovery will automatically no shut the port to give the user another try
  * By default, recovery is disabled for all causes. 
  * My favorite, `errdisable recovery cause bpdguard`
  * Set the interval with `errdisable recovery interval <seconds>` 
     * deafult is 300 
# Verity with `show errdisable recovery`  

#### 1.1.a iii L2 MTU
* When setting the L2 MTU on an interface, the command doesn't include the MTU overhead  
  * Ethernet header adds 18 bytes (inc 802.1Q)  
* Needs to be 9000 for SD-Access
* Setting the system mtu sets routed and switched ports 

### 1.1.b Layer 2 protocols
#### 1.1.b i CDP, LLDP
* Cisco Discovery Protocol 
  * Enabled by default
  * Enable/disable with `[no] cdp run` globally or per-interface 
  * Times can be tuned 
  * By default, v2 enabled 
* Link Layer Discovery Protocol
  * Open standard 
  * Disabled by deafult, enable globally with `lldp run`
  * Enable/disable per-interface with `[no] lldp transmit` and `[no] lldp receive`
  * Tunable timers 
  * Includes extra TLVs, including 
    * Mandatory
      * Port description
      * System Name
      * System Description
      * System capabilities 
      * Management Address
    * Optional 
      * Port VLAN ID 
      * MAC/PHY configuraiton/status 
  * LLDP-MED adds some additional TLVs 
    * By default, all enabled 
    * LLDP-MED capabilties 
    * Network policy TLV (e.g., VLAN and L2/L3 attributes) - uses config object `network-policy profile #` then assigned to port with `network-policy #`
    * Power management TLV 
    * Inventory management TLV - uses config object `location <type> identifier #` then assigned to port with `location <type>-locaiton-id #`
    * Location TLV
  * Enable selectivitely with `switch(config-if)# lldp med-tlv-select inventory management`

#### 1.1.b ii UDLD
* Unidirectional link detection 
* Needs to be enabled on both sides
* Two modes, normal and aggressive, make sure that's the same on both sides 
  * Normal - works on fiber
  * Aggressive - works on fiber and copper 
    * Disable the port if detected 
      * Re-enable with `udld reset` or `shut \n no shut`
    * Uses hello packets as a heartbeat 
* Works on copper and fiber 
* Fast UDLD - timers in the few-hundred ms range, default 200ms 
  * Fast UDLD enabled if both sides have fast configured and have negotiated to move from slow to fast 
* Configuration: 
  * Normal (global): `(config)# udld enable` -> will enable on fiber ports 
  * Normal (interface): `(config-if)# udld port`
  * Agressive (interface): `(config-if)# udld port aggressive`
  * Fast (interface): `(config-if)# udld fast-hello 200` (needs udld enabled first)
  * Report only: `(config)# udld fast-hello error-reporting`
  * Disable per-port: `(config-if)# udld port disable`
* Operating
  * `show udld`
  * `show udld fast-hello`

### 1.1.c VLAN technologies
* Thankfully, there doesn't look anything DTP-related here


#### 1.1.c i Access ports
* Single untagged VLAN 

```
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
```

#### 1.1.c ii Trunk ports (802.1Q)
* Multiple VLANs
* Native = untagged 
* Default native is 1
* Older IOS (15), i.e., IOL in the exam, need `switchport trunk encap dot1q`

```
int gi1/0/2
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan <range or all> ! default all 
switchport trunk native vlan XX
```

#### 1.1.c iii Native VLAN
* See above, untagged VLAN on a trunk port 

#### 1.1.c iv Manual VLAN pruning
* Manually allow or disallow VLANs on a port, for one reason or another 
* Specifiy complete list: `(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 2,3,4,50,99`
* Add a VLAN: `(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan add 156`
* Remove a VLAN: `(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan remove 156`

#### 1.1.c v VLAN database
* `show vlan` 
* Routed ports use internal VLANs 
  * `show vlan internal usage`
  * Uses extended VLANs, you can configure whether it starts at top and goes down or vice verse
    * `(config)# vlan internal allocation policy [ ascending | descending ]`
* Creating a VLAN automatically creates the spanning-tree instance ([r]pvst+) and mac table

#### 1.1.c vi Normal range and extended range VLANs
* Normal - 1-1001
* Token Ring 1002-1005
* Extended 1006-4094


#### 1.1.c vii Voice VLAN
* Uses CDP to tell phones to tag traffic
* `switchport voice vlan 16`
* For QoS,  
  * `(config-if)# trust device cisco-phone`
* Tagged with VLAN 0 (wtf?) - TODO: try to packet cap this
  * `(config-if)# switchport voice vlan dot1p`

#### 1.1.c viii VTP
* VTP is the worst, especially version 2 
* Version 3 ain't so bad. 
* Uses VLAN 1, VLAN 1 can't be pruned by VTP 
* It's got 4 modes, and that's it. 
  1. Server - create, advertise, install
    * Per Cisco, "If the NVRAM and DRAM storage is sufficient, all devices in a VTP domain should be in VTP server mode."
  2. Client - cannot create, but advertise and install
  3. Transparent - forward VTP messages on trunks but don't advertise or install, keep database local 
    * VLAN config saved to NVRAM instead of vlan.dat
  4. Off - do not forward VTP messages on trunks 
    * VLAN config saved to NVRAM instead of vlan.dat
* Configuration revision number
  * Sequence number for the database, highest wins 
  * VTP domain considered sync'd when everyone's config rev number matches 
  * Server or Client can overwrite the database if it has a higher rev number 
* Authentication 
  * `(config)# vtp password CICSO`
    * Compare md5 hashes in # show vtp status 
    * Revision number included in the salt, so revision number changes hash 
* VTP Pruning 
  * Reduces BUM traffic if VLAN not needed downstream
  * Enable with `(config)# vtp pruning`
  * VLAN 2-1001 are prune eligible 
    * EVEN IN VTPv3, only 2-1001 (sorta 1002-1005, which are reserved) 
  * Edit prune eligible list with `(config-if)# switchport trunk pruning vlan`
* Configuration
  * `(config)# vtp domain CISCO`
  * Clients will auto-learn domain if they have default (no) VTP config
* Operations: 
  * `show int trunk`
  * `show int pruning`
  * `show int switchport` 
* VTPv3 
  * Supports extended VLAN range (1006-4094)
  * Uses the EXEC command `vtp primary` to take control of VLAN ownership
  * Has MST support `(config)# vtp primary mst`
  * Supports private VLANs
  * Primary and secondary servers 
    * Primary updates the database and sends updates honored by everyone 
    * Secondary can only backup the VTP configs to NVRAM
    * By default, all VTP servers are secondaries (see above `vtp primary`)
  * Authentication can be hidden or secret
    * hidden - the secret key from the password string is saved in the VLAN database file, but it does not appear in plain text in the configuration. 
      *  You must reenter the password if you enter a takeover command in the domain. 
    * secret - you can directly configure the password secret key  



### 1.1.d EtherChannel
* No PAgP, yay!
* Great for redundancy 
* Not always great for speed, no flow can surpass individual link speed 
* Max 128 per swtich or switch stack 

#### 1.1.d i LACP, static
* Static: `SW(config-if)# channel-group 128 mode on`
  * Just turn it on, don't both negotiating 
  * Often have to do this with WLC 
  * Problem: if other end not configured, the end with it 'on' doesn't care and will forward packets anyway
* LACP - link aggregation control protocol 
  * `SW(config-if)# channel-group 128 mode [ active | passive ]`
  * Member interface and port-channel interface must agree on parameters, like switchport mode [ access | trunk ] or no switchport
    * Also need to be consistent: allowed vlan list, spanning-tree path-cost, spanning-tree port priority, spanning-tree portfast settings
    * Trunk ports sends LACP BPDUs on untagged VLAN
  * Up to 16 ports can be configured, up to 8 will be active at any time 
  * Must be same speed/duplex (but can be mixed media) 
  * LACP Parameters
    * System ID - LACP system ID is a combination of LACP system priority value and MAC of router 
    * Port priority - determine which ports to use if you have more configured than can be active (or put another way, which ones should be put in standby mode) 
    * Administrative Key - determines ability of port to aggregate with other ports, including, data rate, duplex, point-to-point vs shared media 
    * Max number of bundled ports 
* MTU should be configured on port-channel interface and will be propagated to member interfaces
* `show etherchannel summary`

#### 1.1.d ii Layer 2, Layer 3
* Layer 2 - `switchport mode [ access | trunk ]`
* Layer 3 - `no switchport` 
  * assign addresses to port-channel interface

#### 1.1.d iii Load balancing
* Locally significant (does not need to match on both ends) 
* `SW(config)# port-channel load-balance <method>`
* Lots of options: 
  * The default is src-mac
  * dst-ip 
  * dst-mac 
  * dst-mixed-ip-port - host IP and layer 4 port
  * dst-port 
  * src-dst-ip 
  * src-dst-mac 
  * src-dst-mixed-ip-port 
  * src-dst-port 
  * src-ip 
  * src-mac 
  * src-mixed-ip-port 
  * src-port 
  * extended - the 16.12 9300 guide has multiple listed. TODO: test this on live equipment (IOL doesn't have all these options)
    * dst-ip
    * dst-mac
    * dst-port
    * ipv6-label
    * l3-proto
    * src-ip
    * src-mac
    * src-port

#### 1.1.d iv EtherChannel Misconfiguration Guard
* Somehow this is a spanning-tree guard
* `(config)# spanning-tree etherchannel guard misconfig`
* Needs PVST+, RPVST+ or MST 
* Will err-disable if one side is configured and the other is not 

### 1.1.e Spanning- Tree Protocol
* Easy?
  * Elect a root bridge
  * Elect one root port per bridge
  * Elect designated ports (downstream-facing) 

* Root bridge election
  * Switch with lowest bridge ID becomes root
    * bridge ID = bridge priority + system ID extension + MAC
      * bridge priority 0-61440 in increments of 4096
      * System ID extenion 0-4095 (VLAN in [R]PVST+ ) 

* Root port election
  * Elected on lowest path cost
  * Path cost is cumulative link cost to get to root
  * Cost based on inverse bandwidth, higher bandwidth = lower cost 
  * If tie in cost, 
    * Choose lowest upstream bridge ID 
    * Choose lowest upstream port ID 
  * Protip: in `# show spanning-tree`, the "Prio.Nbr" column is not used to make this decision. That value on the UPSTREAM bridge is used to make our decision. 
    * `# show spanning-tree detail` will show us local and remote info. 
    
       ```
