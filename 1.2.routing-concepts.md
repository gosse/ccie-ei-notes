## 1.2 Routing Concepts

### 1.2.a Administrative distance

* A great tie-breaker to see which route goes into the RIB and onto the FIB. 

| Connected      | AD  |
|----------------|-----|
| Connected      | 0   |
| Static         | 1   |
| EIGRP          | 90  |
| EIGRP Summary  | 5   |
| Eigrp External | 170 |
| OSPFv2         | 110 |
| OSPFv3         | 110 |
| eBGP           | 20  |
| iBGP           | 200 |
| RIPv2          | 120 |
| Not Listed     | 255 |

* You can also change the AD of a protocol, or for just some routes from a routing protocol.
* Static - set to 99: `ip route 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.3.5 1 99`
* RIP
  ```
  router rip
  distance 99
  ```
* EIGRP 
  * all routes (in topoblogy-base in named mode) `distance eigrp <internal routes distance> <external routes distance>`
  * Selectively, `distance 99 <source address> <wildcard bits> [ acl ]`
  * The syntax lets you do it per neighbor and/or per network 
* OSPF
  * For all routes of a type, `R(config-router)# distance ospf ext 99 inter-area 99 intra-area 99`
  * Selectively, same as EIGRP, `R(config-router)# distance 99 <source address> <wildcard bits> [ acl ]`
* BGP
  * For all routes of a type, `R(config-router)# distance bgp <eBGP routes> <iBGP routes> <local routes>`
  * Selectively, same, `distance 99 <source address> <wildcard bits> [ acl ]`

### 1.2.b VRF-lite

* VRFs without MPLS 
* Not sure if EVN counts, but can be used to do route-leaking
  ```
  vrf definition EVN
  address-family ipv4
   route-replicate from vrf global unicast all
  exit-address-family
  ```

### 1.2.c Static routing

* `ip route destination_subnet dest_mask next-hop`
* Next-hop can be interface or IP(v6) address 
  * Router will do recursive lookup for destination IP, find the egress interface, ARP for the next-hop and know how to encapsulate the packet to get there. 
  * Only use an egress interface on point-to-point links
  * Avoid using an egress interface on point-to-multipoint links.
    * On multipoint links, the router won't do a recursive lookup and instead will ARP for the final destination address.
    * This requires neighbor routers to have proxy-arp enabled
    * Router will ARP for EVERY destination IP
      * The router will maintain a MAC table for every destination IP it ses (wow)
      * This has bad consequences for a default route...
* Permanent route keyword - route will stay up if recursive lookup fails 
* "Fully specified" includes egress interface and next-hop IP 
* "Reliable static routing" 
  * Use track objects 
  * Have a "floating static route" with a higher metric 
* 3 main steps of routing: 
  * Routing - choose egress interface
  * Switching - move packet between interfaces
  * Encapsulation - rebuild L2 header
* RIB - where all the routes from all the protocols goes, gets distilled into FIB - forwarding information base    
* Check the fib 
  * show ip cef
  * show ip cef exact-route 

### 1.2.d Policy Based Routing

* I do not like it Sam I Am
* Use route-maps! 
  * Permit -> pbr the traffic
  * Deny -> use routing table 
  * Action -> `set ip next-hop`
  * Can be used incoming at the link level, `ip policy route-map`
  * Can be used for locally originated traffic, applied globally, `ip local policy route-map`

### 1.2.e VRF aware routing with any routing protocol

* `show ip route vrf NAME`
* `show ip protocols vrf NAME`
* Static
  * `ip route vrf NAME 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.1`
* EIGRP 
  * Classic Mode - IPv6 not supported
    ```
    router eigrp 300
      address-family ipv4 vrf ei-classic autonomous-system 90
      ...
      exit-address-family
    ```
  * Named mode 
    ```
    router eigrp CCIE
      address-family ipv4 unicast vrf green autonomous-system 2
        ...
      exit-address-family
      address-family ipv6 unicast vrf green autonomous-system 2
        ...
      exit-address-family
    ```
* OSPFv2 & v3
  * Use address-family
  * IPv6 in OSPFv3 only
  * Make sure to define router-id manually 
  * Down bit - if you're a CE devices running OSPF as your PE<>CE, use `capability vrf-lite` to clear down-bit 
* BGP 
  * You can use address-families in VRF 
  * Use vpnv4 commands to verify neighborships, bgp tables, etc. 

### 1.2.f Route filtering with any routing protocol

* EIGRP 
  * Done in router config for classic mode, in topology-base for named mode. 
  * distribute-list
    * Use ACL, prefix-list, gateway, or route-map  
    * in -> ignore routes coming in (can't specify interface) 
    * out  -> don't send these routes out (can be per interface)
    * ACL example:  
      ```
      router ei 100 
        distribute-list ACL-DL-EI100-OUT out gi1/0/3
        distribute-list ACL-DL-EI100-IN in
      ```
     * Route map would be `distribute-list route-map <map name> [ in | out ]`
   * Change AD from source with `distance` command 
     * Sometimes, you might want one neighbor's routes preferred over another
     * You can set the AD of incoming routes, `(config-rtr)# distance 50 <route source IP> <route source wildcard mask> <ACL name or number (optional)>`
* OSPF
  * distribute-list 
    * Remember, we are link state routing protocol so you cannot filter LSAs within an area (but you can filter external LSAs)  
    * no `distribute-list out` in OSPF
    * Can be based on ACL, gateway, prefix, route-map (usually route-map)  
    * You can filter what comes FROM the LSDB *to* the RIB, based on tag, type, source, interface, next-hop in route-map
    * You can use a distribute-list out to filter external routes, but not internal  
  * Type-3 LSA filtering - `filter-list`
    * Filter LSAs between areas 
    * Must use a prefix-list 
    * `area ID filter-list prefix-list NAME [ in | out ]`
* BGP  
  * You can choose one method
    * Order of preference for inbound updates:
      1. route-map
      2. filter-list
      3. prefix-list | distribute-list  (mutually exclusive, you can only apply one in each direction)
    * Order of preference for outbound updates:
      1. filter-list
      2. route-map | unsupress-map  (mutually exclusive)
      3. advertise-map 
      4. prefix-list | distribute-list (mutually exclusive, you can only apply one in each direction)
      5. ORF prefix-list
  * route-map
    * Per neighbor 
    * How the cool kids do it
  * distribute-list 
    * in AF
    * Per neighbor  
    * Uses and ACL 
    * You can use this if you want to use an ACL to filter routes instead of a route-map, if you're a crazy person 
  * filter-list
    * Per neighbor
    * Use a as-path ACL 
      ```
      ip as-path access-list 10 premit ^65101
      !
      router bgp 65000
       address-family ipv6 unicast
        neighbor 10.1.1.2 filter-list 10 [ in | out ]
       exit-address-family
      ```
  * prefix-list 
    * Per neighbor
    * Uses a prefix-list
  * advertise-map 
    * See BGP section 
  * unsurpress-map
    * See BGP section
  * ORF prefix-list 
    * ORF = outbound route filtering 
    * BGP speaker can tell peer which routes the peer is allowed to advertise to it
    * Create & apply a prefix-list outbound to that peer and send capability ORF 
    ```
    ip prefix-list ORF_TEST permit 192.168.0.0/16 
    router bgp 65101
     address-family ipv4 uni
      neighbor 10.1.1.2 prefix-list ORF_TEST in
      neighbor 10.1.1.2 capability orf prefix-list send
     exit-address-family 
    ```
    * Verify with `show ip bgp nei 10.1.1.2` and look for section on ORF  
  * table-map 
    * Prevent IOS from installing routes into RIB 
    * Table-map references a route-map
    * Filter keyword:
      * no filter keyword: the route-map can be used to set attributes but routes will always be put in RIB regardless of permit/deny
      * with filter keyword: route-map reference will also deny routes into RIB 
      * Doesn't work for MPLS L3VPN - route download already automatically suppressed on RR 
      * Configured within AF 
      ```
      route-map bgp-to-rib deny 10
      !
      router bgp 65000
       address-family ipv6 unicast
       table-map bgp-to-rib filter
      ```
  

### 1.2.g Manual summarization with any routing protocol

* Auto-summary automatically summarizes routes into classful routes. It's stupid. It's no longer the default on modern IOS (after 15).
* Another manual summarization option is to create the Null0 super route and redistribute that, but that doesn't usually suppress more-specific routes already in the RIB-in/RIB/FIB
* EIGRP 
  * One of the coolest things about EIGRP is you can perform summarization anywhere
  * Configured at the interface level 
  * IPv4 - classic mode: `R(config-if)# ip summary-address eigrp 100 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0`
  * IPv4 - named mode:
  ```
  router eigrp CCIE
   address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 100
    af-interface gi3
     summary address 192.168.0.0/16 
    exit-af-interface
  exit-address-family
  ```
  * IPv6 - classic mode: `R(config-if)# ipv6 summary-address eigrp 1 2001:DB8:10:1::/64`
  * IPv6 - named mode:
  ```
  router eigrp CCIE
   address-family ipv6 unicast autonomous-system 100
    af-interface gi3
     summary address ::0/0
    exit-af-interface
  exit-address-family
  ```
* OSPFv2 and v3 
  * `summary-address` (IPv4 only)
    * Summarize external routes
    * `R#(config-router) summary-address 10.0.0.0 255.255.0.0`
    * You can set a tag with _tag_ keyword
    * You can filter these routes out with the _not-advertise_keyword
    * You can use the _nssa-only_ keyword to limit the summary only to NSSA areas 
  * `summary-prefix` (IPv6 only)
    * Same as summary-address, but for IPv6 in OSPFv3 
  * `area X range` (v4 and v6)
    * Summarize routes on ABR (inter-area)
    * `area 1 range 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0`
    * Area # is the area to be summarized, the command above would summarize all routes in area 1 in the range 192.168.0.0/16 to 192.168.0.0/16
    * Optional `cost` - specify metric for range
    * Optional `not-advertise` to suppress the route 
* BGP
  * Aggregate-address: `R1(config-router)# aggregate-address 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 as-set`
    * A longer-prefix route must be in the BGP RIB to generate the aggregate
    * as-set
      * keyword specifies the path advertised is an AS_SET
      * Don't use _as-set_ when aggregating lots of routes, the prefix is withdrawn and readvertised every time one of the underlying routes reachability changes
      * AS-Path shows up in {} in bgp table (helps avoid loops)
    * summary-only
      * filter all more specific routes 
    * suppress-map
      * Create the aggregate but suppress the advertisement of routes in the map 
      * Lets you selectively not advertise more-specific routes 
    * advertise-map
      * Helps decide which attributes the aggregate will carry 
      * "In general, when you use advertise-map, only the advertise-map influences the aggregate. In the absence of advertise-map, the aggregate inherits the attributes of the more-specific routes, both suppressed and unsuppressed. In both the cases, you can use the attribute-map configuration command to override the chosen attributes." - [Understanding Route Aggregation in BGP](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/5441-aggregation.html#aggregatingwithouttheassetargument)
    * attribute-map
      * Set attributes on the aggregate
  * Other ways, route-maps, neighbor distribute-list, etc. 

### 1.2.h Redistribution between any pair of routing protocols

* Remember, the routes you want to redistirbute must be in the RIB from the routing protocol you're redistributing from. 
  * E.g., if you learn a route from OSPF and EIGRP, you will only redistirbute it if you're redistributing from EIGRP
* Route tag to avoid continual redistirbution 
* Use route-maps for control 
* When redistributing between two protocols on the same device and the route originates from that device in another protocol (e.g., redistribute EIGRP 100 to EIGRP 200, but redistribute a Connected route), the target protocol will konw where that route originally came from (in previous example, `show ip eigrp topology` will show the route sourced from Connected, even though you are redistributing EIGRP 100, not Connected). 
* From OSPFv2 to ANY protocol: 
  * No IPV6 support in OSPFv2
  * Make sure to use the match option appropriately. By default, without match, IOS will only redistribute internal routes (intra- and inter-area routes)
  * Match options: 
  	* internal
  	* external 1
  	* external 2 
  	* nssa-external 1
  	* nssa-external 2
* IPv6 Specials 
  * include-connected: 
   * For IPv4 address families, connected interfaces that are running the routing process are redistributed into the other process. 
   * IPv6 does not do this by default, either use include-connected or redist conn separately 
* EIGRP 
  * When redistributing into EIGRP, you need to deal with metric, one of two ways:
    1. Set the metric on redistribution, `redist PROTOCOL [#] metric <bandwidth> <delay> <reliability> <load> <mtu>` 
    2. Set the default metric, `default-metric <bandwidth> <delay> <reliability> <load> <mtu>`
  * As always, use route-maps to be safe when redistributing
  * From Static to EIGRP
    * Configure (new style):

      * `sh ip ei topo`

* OSPFv2 
  * When you redistribute into OSPF, the redistributing router becomes an ASBR 
  * Subnet keyword - if you don't use the subnets keyword when redistributing, only classful networks are redistributed 
    * You almost always want this. 
  * Other options: 
    * route-map 
    * metric - default is 20, set from 0-16777214 
    * metric-type 
      1. 1 - E1/N1 routes are preferred over E2/N2 routes. Their cost is the cost of the external metric + internal cost with OSPF to reach that network. 
      2. 2 - E2/N2 routes cost is just the external metric, ignores internal.
    * nssa-only 
      * Per Cisco, "The nssa-only keyword instructs the device to instigate Type-7 LSA with cleared P-bit, thereby, preventing LSA translation to Type 5 on NSSA ABR device."
      * The P-bit is a loop-prevention mechanism. P = propagate 
        * The P-bit tells the ABR if the Type 7 LSA should be translated into a Type 5 into area 0. Only LSAs with P-bit set will be translated to type-5. 
      * Setting this option means the route will only be kept within the NSSA and not sent out to the rest of the OSPF routing domain 
    * Tag - tag the route as it goes into OSPF. This tag does get passed to other routers.

  * From BGP to BGP
    * Unlike other protocols, you can only run one instance of BGP per router 
    * For multi-VRF BGP, use vpnv4 address families (even without MPLS) to have different BGP process in different VRFs 
    * Use local-as to show up as a different AS to your neighbor other than your BGP process
    * If you need routes from one BGP VPN AF to another, use route-leaking 
  * From RIPv2 to BGP
    * Hopefully you never have to do this

### 1.2.i Routing protocol authentication

* Key chains 
* Use send-lifetime and accept-lifetime to roll your keys gracefully 
  ```
  key-chain <name>
   key <#>
    key-string <text>
    accept-lifetime
    send-lifetime
  ```
* EIGRP 
  * MD5 based 
    * Classic mode, interface config 
      * IPv4 `R(config-if)# ip authentication mode eigrp 100 md5` and `R(config-if)# ip authentication key-chain eigrp 100 KEY-CHAIN-NAME`
      * IPv6 `R(config-if)# ipv6 authentication mode eigrp 100 md5` and `R(config-if)# ipv6 authentication key-chain eigrp 100 KEY-CHAIN-NAME`
    * Named mode - configure in af-interface 
      ```
      router eigrp CCIE
        address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 100
          af-interface gi3
            authentication key-chain KEY-CHAIN-NAME

            authentication mode md5
          exit-af-interface  
        exit-address-family
      ```
  * HMAC-SHA-256
    ```
    router eigrp CCIE
      address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 100
        af-interface gi3
          authentication mode hmac-sha-256 0 MY-SECRET-PASSWORD

          authentication mode hmac-sha-256 0 MY-SECRET-PASSWORD
        exit-af-interface  
      exit-address-family
    ```
* OSPFv2
  * Interface-level config for plain text
    ```
    ip ospf authentication
    ip ospf authentication-key MY-SECRET-AUTH-KEY
    ```
  * Interface-level config for MD5
    ```
    int gi3
     ip ospf authentication-key 1 
     ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 23456789 
     ip ospf authentication message-digest 
    ```
  * Use a key-chain for better crypto 
    ```
    key-chain <name>
     key <#>
      key-string <text>
      cryptographic-alogirthm hmac-sha-256
    int gi3
     ip ospf authentication key-chain NAME
    ```
* OSPFv3
  * Use IPSec for authentication 
    * For entire area: `(config-rtr)# area 0 authentication ipsec spi 1000 md5 <key>`
    * Per interface:
      ```
      interface Gi1
        ipv6 enable
        ipv6 ospf 100 area 0
        ipv6 ospf authentication ipsec spi 1000 md5 <key>
      interface gi2
        ipv6 enable
        ipv6 ospf authentication null
        ipv6 ospf 100 area 0
      ```
  * Authentication Trailer
    * RFC4552
    * Uses a key-chain
    * Can define crypto
    * Can be done per-interface or at the process
    * Set at "AT-BIT" -> can be seen in `# show ospfv3 nei detail`
    ```
    key-chain <name>
     key <#>
      key-string <text>
      cryptographic-alogirthm hmac-sha-256
    int gi3
     ospfv3 101 ipv4 authentication key-chain OSPF-KEY-CHAIN
    router ospfv3 101
     area 0 authentication key-chain OSPF-KEY-CHAIN
    ```
* BGP 
  * Use MD5 `neighbor 203.113.0.2 password cisco`
  * Use TCP authentication option 
    ```
    key chain BGP-AO tcp
      key 900
        send-id 190
        recv-id 190
        key-string ciscocisco
        cryptographic-algorithm hmac-sha-1

    router bgp 65101
      neighbor 203.0.113.2 ao BGP-AO 
    ```

### 1.2.j Bidirectional Forwarding Detection

* Use command `bfd interval` to initiate BFD monitoring, e.g., `bfd interval 100 min_rx 100 multiplier 3`
* Protocol independent, can even be used for static routes 
* BGP - `neighbor 10.1.1.1 fall-over bfd`
* EIGRP 
  * `(config-router)#bfd all-interfaces` or `(config-router)#bfd interface GigabitFastEthernet 1/0/1`
* IS-IS
  * `(config-router)#bfd all-interfaces` 
  * Or `(config-if)# isis bfd`
* OSPF 
  * `(config-router)#bfd all-interfaces` 
  * Or `(config-if)# ip ospf bfd`
* HSRP 
  * `(config-if)# standby bfd`
  * Or globally, `# standby bfd all-interfaces`
* Static
  * Set up on interface `bfd interval 100 min_rx 100 multiplier 3`
  * Then, `ip route static bfd <interface> <next-hop IP> group BFDGROUP` and `# ip route 10.4.3.0 255.255.255.0 gi3 <next-hop IP>`
* Verify: 
  * `show bfd nei details`
* BFD echo mode is enabled by default
  * Turning it off helps improve detection time 
  * `(config)# no bfd echo`
  * TODO: find out more about this and why you would/would not want it 
* Use a template if you want 
  ```
  bfd-template single-hop my-bfd-template
   interval min-tx 120 min-rx 100 multiplier 3  
 ```
* `sh bfd neighbors`
* `show bfd nei detail`
* `debug bfd packet`
* `debug bfd event`
