### 1.3 EIGRP

* 1.3.a Adjacencies
  * Those damn K values must match, `show ip protocols`
  * Neighbor discovery is multicast, once discovered, unicast
    * 224.0.0.10
  * ASN must match 
  * Router-ID must be unique 
  * `show ip ei nei` -> when Q count is 0, fully converged with enighbor
  * EIGRP sends two packet types, reliable and unreliable
    * Unreliable: 
      * Hellos
      * Acknowledgements 
    * Reliable - these are sequenced, require an ACK and are retransmitted 16 times if not ack'd
      * Updates
      * Queries
      * Replies
      * SIA-Queries
      * SIA-Replies
* 1.3.b Best path selection
  * 1.3.b i RD, FD, FC, successor, feasible successor
    * Feasibility condition is used to select the loop-free backup path 
      * Sub-second reconvergence
      * Fault isolation
      * First, find the best path, then find alternate paths
        * Anything with metric less than X is closer to the destination than me, so exclude anyone with a metric >= X
    * Successor = Best Path 
    * Feasible Successor = Backup Path that meet feasability condition
      * RD < FD (LESS THAN, not `<=`)
      * Only FS can be used for load balancing 
    * FD = composite metric of successor
    * RD = composite metric learned from neighbor
  * 1.3.b ii Classic Metrics and Wide Metrics
    * Classic metric 
      * composite metric -> 256 * ((K1 * Scaled Bw) + (K2 * Scaled Bw)/(256 â€“ Load) + (K3 * Scaled Delay)*(K5/(Reliability + K4))) 
      * By default, only uses K1 and K2, so bandwidth + delay
        * Change with `metric weights K1 K2 K3 K4 K5`
      * Bandwidth = bandwidth along path in kbps scaled by 10^7/minimum bandwidth
      * Delay = cumulative delay based in tens of microseconds, scaled delay/10 
      * Load = highest load along path, 0 to 255, 255 is 100% loaded  
      * MTU = minimum MTU along path 
      * Reliability = lowest reliabiliyt along path, 255 means 100% reliable 
    * Wide metrics
      * 64 bit, but IOS RIB only supports 32 bit metric
        * Scaled by dividing by 128 
        * Sometimes, using route-maps with "set metric" can cause issues with older peers 
      * delay is now measured in picoseconds 
      * bandwidth now called throughput
      * delay now called latency 
      * default is still bandwidth + delay 
      * Backwards compatible
  * Summarizaiton 
    * Chooses the metric of the lowest cost component route as the summary metric 
      * This works ok unless the component routes are continually flapping, which then makes EIGRP continually send out updates for the metric of the summary route 
      * Solution - use a loopback with a lower metric than anyone else and put that in the summary
      * Solution - use `summary-metric` command
* 1.3.c Operations
  * 1.3.c i General operations
    * Reconvergance 
      * Without FS in table: 
        * Route goes into ACTIVE state
        * Queries packet sent to all neighbors asking for an alternative path 
        * Reconverged only once REPLY received from all neighbors
        * SIA problem 
      * With FS in table: 
        * Loss of successor does not make route 'active'
        * FS promoted to successor
        * No QUERY packets generated
        * SUb-second
  * 1.3.c ii Topology table
    * Traffic engineering generally uses the delay command 
    * `show ip ei topo`
    * `sho ip ei topo all-links`
    * `show ip ei topology <network/mask>`
    * `show ip ei topo zero` - routes that fail to install because there is a route with a better AD already installed 
    * Traffic Filtering with extended ACL 
      * For IGPs, like RIP and EIGRP, an extended access list in a distribute-list is special 
      * "Source" Field = source of route 
      * "Destination" Field = network address 
      * This lets you control WHICH networks you are receiving and who you're receiving them FROM 
  * 1.3.c iii Packet types
    * Hello (Hello and ACK)
    * Query (Query and SIA-Query)
    * Reply (Reply and SIA-Reply)
    * Request 
    * Update 
  * 1.3.c iv Stuck In Active
    * If a route goes ACTIVE and a router doesn't hear from a peer in 90 seconds, it sends a SIA 
    * `show ip ei topo active`
    * Likely causes:
      * bad or congested links 
      * query range too long 
      * excessive redundancy
      * high cpu 
      * memory shortage 
      * software bugs 
    * Limit query domain with EIGRP stubs 
      * Use for non-transit routers 
      * Stubs don't advertise routes learned from other neighbors 
      * Stubs advertise connected and summary routes by default 
      * Stubs query non-stubs 
      * Stubs should not be queried for Active or SIA 
    * Stub SITE for DMVPN 
      * If you have more than one router in a stub, you can mark the entire site as a stub site
      * Added for IWAN 
      * Configure in tunnel af-interface to hub site, `stub-site wan-interface`
      * Configure stub routers with the same site-id -> `eigrp stub-site 1:1`
        * This lets stub routers advertise routes to each other
  * 1.3.c v Graceful shutdown
* 1.3.d EIGRP load-balancing
  * Paths need to meet feasibility condition 
  * 1.3.d i Equal-cost
    * 4 links by default
    * Use `maximum-paths` to increase
  * 1.3.d ii Unequal-cost
    * Use `variance` command 
    * Traffic share is calculated by proportion to composite metrics 
  * 1.3.d iii Add-path
    * Allows DMVPN hub to advertise multiple best paths 
    * Needed when two or more spokes advertise same subnet
    * Configure on the hub
      ```
      router eigrp CCIE
        address-family ipv4 auto 10
          af-interface tunnel 0
            no next-hop-self no-ecmp-mode
            add-paths 4
          exit-af-int
        address-family ipv6 auto 10
          af-interface tun 0
            no next-hop-self no-ecmp-mode
            add-paths 4
          exit-af-int
      ```
* 1.3.e EIGRP Named Mode
  * Consistent config, including vrf lite 
  * Wide metrics 
* 1.3.f Optimization, convergence and scalability
  * 1.3.f i Fast convergence requirements
    * You need a feasible successor, RD<FD
  * 1.3.f ii Query propagation boundaries
    * Use a stub
  * 1.3.f iii IP FRR (single hop)
    * Use named mode
    * Must be feasible successors
    * Less than 50 ms convergence
    * In topo-base, `fast-reroute per-prefix [ all route-map ]`
    * To view, `show ip ei topo frr`
  * 1.3.f iv Leak-map with summary routes
    * Leak parts of the summary
    * Use a route map
    * Interface or af-interface, `summary-address 192.168.0.0/16 leak-map RM_LEAK`
  * 1.3.f v EIGRP stub with leak map
    * Stub flavors:
      * Receive-only - obvious
      * Connected - stub router will advertise connected networks (you have to redist)
      * Static - stub route will advertise static routes (you have to redist)
      * Summary - stub router will advertise summary routers (you have to configure)
      * Redistribute - stub router will advertise redistribted routes (you have to redist)
      * Default is conected + summary (you still have to redist)
    * Stub leak map: 
      * `(config-router)# eigrp stub leak-map ROUTE-MAP`

* Other EIGRP topics I should take some notes on: 
  * EIGRP down-bit (SD-WAN)
  * EIGRP SoO 
  * EIGRP route tagging and enhanced route tagging
