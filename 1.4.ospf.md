### 1.4 OSPF (v2 and v3)

* 1.4.a Adjacencies
  * Discovery uses multicast hello packets 
  * 224.0.0.5 or 224.0.0.6 
  * Need to get some attributes right for neighborship 
    * Unique - these must NOT match 
      * router ID
      * Interface IP 
    * Common - these must MATCH 
      * MTU!!! 
      * Area ID 
      * hello/dead interval 
      * IP subnet 
      * network type (p2p, broadcast, p2mp)
      * authentication 
      * stub flags 
      * other optional capabiltiies 
    * Some OSPF neighbors stay in 2WAY/DROTHER - this is normal on a broadcast or nbma 
    * OSPF State Machine - 8 states 
      * Down (no hellos received) 
      * Attempt (only seen on manually configured neighbors)
      * Init (received hello, my hello not ack'd)
      * 2-WAY (received ack)
      * ExStart - master/slave established, master with higher RID 
      * Exchange - LSDB sync'd through DBD packets (reliable with DBD Seq numbers)
      * Loading (LSR packets sent to ask more info about a particular LSA)
      * Full (yay all done)
  * Neighbor considered dead after missing hellos with dead interval
    * Default dead interval is 4x hello
  * DR/BDR elected on broadcast/nbma segments to reduce flooding
    * No preemption - have tore-elect 
    * Priority 0 - never elect me 
    * Highest RID wins if no priority set 
* 1.4.b Network types, area types
  * Network Types 
    * Point-to-Point
    * Broadcast
    * Non-broadcast
      * Does not support broadcast/multicast
      * E.g., ATM, frame relay
      * NBMA
        * Emulates broadcast
        * BD/BDR elected
      * Point-to-Multipoint 
        * Neighbors must be manually configured
  * Area Types 
    * Backbone (0 or 0.0.0.0) 
      * All areas must connect to teh backbone
      * Must be contiguous 
    * Normal Areas 
    * Stubs 
      * ABR enforces filtering and control which LSAs enter the area 
      * All routers in the area must agree on the stub flags as part of adjacency negotiation  
      * Stub 
        * NO external routes 
        * YES inter-area routes 
        * NO local redistribution
        * YES automatic default route 
        * `area 2 stub`
      * Totally Stubby - basically just a default only 
        * NO external routes 
        * NO inter-area routes 
        * NO local redistribution
        * YES automatic default route 
        * `area 2 stub no-summary`
      * NSSA - allow redistribution but don't put a default route in automatically 
        * NO external routes 
        * YES inter-area routes 
        * YES local redistribution
        * NO automatic default route  
        * `area 2 nssa`
      * Totally NSSA - totally stubby with redistribution (no inter-area routes) 
        * NO external routes 
        * NO inter-area routes 
        * YES local redistribution
        * YES automatic default route 
        * `area 2 nssa no-summary`
  * `adjacency-stagger` - configure maximum limit and initial limit for an area
    * Default 300 
    * Minimum 1 
    * `Device(config-router)# adjacency stagger <initial limit> <maximum limit>` - lets you stagger bringing up neighbors 
* 1.4.c Path preference
  * Path selection is based on Dijkstra 
  * Shortest Path Tree- SPT 
  * Preferred order: 
    * O
    * O IA
    * E1
    * N1
    * E2
    * N2
  * Influence path selection: 
    * interface bandwidth 
    * interface `ip ospf cost`
    * auto-cost reference bandwidth 
    * neighbor cost (can also have ACL)
* 1.4.d Operations
  * 1.4.d i General operations
  * 1.4.d ii Graceful shutdown
    * Per interface, `(config-if)# ip ospf shutdown`
  * 1.4.d iii GTSM (Generic TTL Security Mechanism)
    * Set outgoing packets with an IP header Time to Live (TTL) value of 255 
    * Discards incoming packets that have TTL values less than threshold
    * Protection against CPU utilization-baed attacks and DoS attacks against OSPF 
    * `(config-router)# ttl-security all-interfaces [ hops <count> ]`
    * `(config-if)# ip ospf ttl-security [ hops <count> | disable ]`
* 1.4.e Optimization, convergence and scalability
  * 1.4.e i Metrics
  * 1.4.e ii LSA throttling, SPF tuning, fast hello
    * LSA throttling
      * OSPFv2 
        * Enabled by default and allows for faster OSPF convergence 
        * Control sending and receiving LSAs - can slow down LSAs if needed
          ```
          router ospf 100
           timers throttle lsa all <start-interval> <hold> <max>
           timers lsa arrival <ms>
          ```
      * OSPFv3 
        ```
        router ospfv3 [ process-id ]
        timers lsa arrival milliseconds
        timers pacing flood milliseconds
        timers pacing lsa-group seconds
        timers pacing retransmission milliseconds 
        ```
      * Flood reduction
        * `ip ospf flood-reduction`
      * Demand Circuit 
        * Suppress hello and LSA refresh 
        * `(config-if)# ip ospf demand-circuit`
    * SPF Tuning
      * iSPF - incremental SPF 
      * Timers pacing - lets you configure LSA refresh timing 
    * Fast Hello 
      * Default 10s hello on ethernet links, dead default 4x 
      * Fast hello - send at less than 1 second interval 
      * Configured, confusingly, by the `ip ospf dead-interval` command 
      * When configured, the 'hello interval' sent out in neighbor discovery is set to 0 and ignored on incoming packets 
      * When configured, the dead interval is set to '1' for fast hello and must be consistent on segment
      * `(config-if)# ip ospf dead-interval minimal hello-multipler <multiplier>`
        * When multiplier set to 5, 5 hellos will be sent out each second 
  * 1.4.e iii LSA propagation control (area types)
    * One interesting way to optimize the database with a network that has point-to-point Ethernet links is to set the network type to point-to-point
      * This elimiates Type 2 LSA for these links 
    * LSA Types (OSPFv2)
      * Type 1 - router 
        * Not flooded outside its area 
        * Includes all links in area, link costs, link neighbors 
      * Type 2 - network
        * Generated by DR on broadcast and non-broadcast networks
        * How all other routers get the Type 1's 
        * Used on broadcast networks and nbma (ethernet) 
        * NOT used on p2p, p2mp, and p2mpnb 
      * Type 3 - network summary 
        * Generated by ABR 
        * Flooded FROM area 0 TO non-backbone areas 
        * Includes cost, but hides ABR's cost to destination
        * SPF *not* run for type 3 routes 
          * Sort of distance vectory-y
      * Type 4 - ASBR Summary
        * Generated by *ABR* 
        * Flooded FROM area 0 into non-backbone areas 
        * Describes how the ABR reaches ASBRs in *other* areas 
          * includes cost information but not full path information 
        * SPF not run, like type 3
      * Type 5 - External 
        * Generated by ASBR to all non-stub areas 
        * Describes what route is redistributing 
          * metric 
          * Metric type 
            * 1 - cumulative cost 
            * 2 (deafult) - flat metric 
          * Forward address 
          * Route tag
      * Type 6 - multicast LSA, not used  
      * Type 7 - NSSA 
        * Generated by ASBR *INSIDE* of NSSA 
        * Changed to type 5 as it crosses into area 0 
        * P-BIT -> tell the ABR whether or not to to send the route into area 0
          * You can only influence this when the ABR is also the ASBR 
          * `summary-address <net> <mask> not-advertise`
      * Type 8, 9, 10 - opaque LSA used for other stuff 
      * OSPFv3 LSAs 
        * Type 8 - Link LSA 
        * Type 9 - Intra-area prefix LSA 
    * Stupid OSPF tricks
      * Filter the OSPF database 
        * `(config-router)# neighbor 1.1.1.1 database-filter all out`
          * OSPF neighbor forms but does not send any LSAs out to that neighbor 
          * You CANNOT selectively filter the database, but you can filter ALL
  * 1.4.e iv Stub router
    * Stubs defined above
    * Stupid stub area tricks: 
      * In addition to database filtering, you can use stubs for traffic engineering 
      * For example, say you have two ABRs in an NSSA 
        * From normal routers in the area, there are multiple exit points 
        * If you make one router think the area is NSSA, it will set OIA into the area 
        * If you make the other router think it's TNSSA, it will only send a default route 
        * Make the metric better on the TNSSA router and you'll send routes for E traffic (and default) there and O-IA traffic to the other 
      * Elect type-7 to type-5 translor
        * If NSSA has multiple ABRs, only one will translate your type 7s to type 5s
        * The router with the highest router-id has this responsibility 
      * `area X nssa translate type7 suppress-fa`
        * In OSPF, the forward address tells who the next recursive lookup should be for an External route 
        * Typcally, type-5 LSAs have a forward address of 0.0.0.0, which means lookup toward the *advertising router*
        * However, type-5 LSAs translated from a type-7 have the forward address set to the ABR
          * If you want to have the route show up with an FA of 0.0.0.0, you can translate your type7 and suppress-fa 
  * 1.4.e v Loop-free alternate
    * Get ready for failure by pre-computing loop free alternative routes 
    * Configure: `(config-router)#  fast-reroute per-prefix enable prefix-priority <priority-level> `
      * `low-priority` -> all prefixes have the same eligibility for protection
      * `high-priority` -> only high-priority prefixes are protected
        * Set high-priority prefixes with `(config-router)# prefix-priority high route-map RM-OSPF-PREFIX-PRIORITY`
    * `show ip ospf fast-reroute`
    * Tuning:
      * Keep all paths: `(config-router)# fast-reroute keep-all-paths`
      * Disable an interface for being an FRR: `(config-if)# ip ospf fast-reroute per-prefix candidate disable`
  * 1.4.e vi Prefix suppression
    * Reduce LSA flooding in an area by reducing number of LSAs 
    * `(config-router)# prefix-suppression`
    * `(config-if)# ip ospf prefix-suppression`
    * Don't flood transit link LSA (don't flood prefixes configured on an interface)
