### 1.5 BGP

* 1.5.a IBGP and EBGP peer relationships
  * 1.5.a i Peer-group/update-group, template
    * Peer-group
      * Great for identical neighbors 
      * Unwiedly when you get similar but not identical neighbor  
    * Update-group 
      * Software automatically groups peers into groups for message updates 
      * `show ip bgp update-group`
      * Recalculate: `clear ip bgp update-group` 
      * `debug ip bgp groups`
    * Template 
      * Flexible/hierarichal peer configuraiton scheme 
      * One template can inherit another 
      * `show ip bgp template peer-session`
      * `show ip bgp template peer-policy`
      * Two kinds: policy and session templates 
        * Session Template - group configuration of general session commands that span address families 
          * description, disable-connected-check, ebgp-multihop, exit peer-session, inherit peer-session, local-as, password, remote-as, shutdown, timers, translate-update, update-source, version 
        * Policy Template - group configuration of commands specific to address families 
          * advertisement interval, allowas-in, as-override, capability, default-originate, distribute-list, dmzlink-bw, filter-list, inherit peer-policy, maximum-prefix, next-hop-self, next-hop-unchanged, prefix-list, remove-private-as, route-map, route-reflector-client, send-comunity, send-label, soft-reconfiguration, unsurpress-map, weight
  * 1.5.a ii Active, passive
    * The difference is which end of the TCP connection has 179
    * Active - default, will try to peer
    * Passive - listen only, `neighbor 150.1.1.5 transport connection-mode passive`
  * 1.5.a iii Timers
    * Keepalive/hold
      * `neighbor 10.3.3.3 timers <keepalive> <hold>`
      * Default keepalive 60, hold 180 
    * Scan - 60 by default 
  * 1.5.a iv Dynamic neighbors
    * I don't like this, but it can be done 
    * Neighbors using subnet ranges 
    * IPv4 peering only 
    ```
    router bgp 45000
     bgp log-neighbor-changes
     bgp listen limit 200
     bgp listen range 172.21.0.0/16 peer-group GROUPA  
     bgp listen range 192.168.0.0/16 peer-group GROUPB
     neighbor GROUPA peer-group 
     ...
     neighbor GROUPB peer-group
     ...   
    ```
  * 1.5.a v 4-bytes AS numbers
    * We ran out of 2 byte AS numbers 
    * You can use it at decimal or two 2-byte numbers, `bgp asnotation dot`
  * 1.5.a vi Private AS
    * 2 byte -> 64512-65535
    * 4 byte -> 4200000000-4294967294 
* 1.5.b Path selection
  * 1.5.b i Attributes
  * 1.5.b ii Best path selection algorithm
    * We Love Orange AS Orange Mean Pure Refreshment 
    1. Weight - local to router, Cisco-specific 
    2. Local Pref - higher wins 
    3. Origin - prefer locally originated routes over redistributed over local aggregate-address 
       * Ignore Accumluated IGP attribute (AIGP) `bgp bestpath aigp ignore`
    4. Shortest AS_PATH 
       * Skip with `bgp bestpath as-path ignore`
       * As AS_SET counts as 1, always
       * AS_CONFED stuff ignored
    5. Origin type 
       * IGP is lower than EGP, EGP is lowest than INCOMPLETE  
    6. Lowest MED 
       * `bgp always-compare-med` will compare MED for all paths 
       * `bgp pbestpath med-confed` MEDs are compared for paths that consist of only AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE
       * Paths with no MED are assigned 0, unless `bgp bestpath med missing-as-worst`
       * `bgp deterministic-med` tries to ensure accurate MED comparison across routes received from the same AS and pick the lowest MED even if the route was received later 
    7. Prefer eBGP over iBGP paths 
    8. Prefer lowest IGP metric to BGP next-hop
    9. Determine if mutiple paths are needed based on BGP multipath 
    10. When both paths are external, prefer the first path received 
        * Skip if `bgp best path compare-routerid` is configured
        * Router-ID is same for multiple paths 
        * There is no current best path 
    11. Prefer routes from BGP router with lowest Router ID 
    12. Prefer path with minimum cluster list length (only in RR environments)
    13. Prefer path from lowest neighbor address 
  * 1.5.b iii Load-balancing
    * You can install up to 6 paths 
    * Usually, the `maximum-paths #` command used in `router bgp` config
      * `maximum-paths ibgp #`
    * Also `maximum-paths eibgp 4` in address family 
    * TE with prefix length 
    * TE with as-path-prepend 
    * Unequal load balancing `dmzlink-bw`
      * When you have different link bandwidth to ISPs 
      * Two things to configure: 
        * Configure `dmzlink-bw` option on all BGP neighbors 
        * Configure `bgp dmzlink-bw` option in the routing process 
* 1.5.c Routing policies
  * * You can use a `continue` clause in a route-map to keep evaluating 
  * 1.5.c i Attribute manipulation
    * You can manipulate most BGP attributes
    * Like next-hop, that's a BGP attribute 
    * Do it in a route-map! 
    * Manipulate weight: `set weight #` in route-map 
    * Manipulate local pref: `set local-preference #` in route-map 
    * Manipulate as-path: `set as-ath prepend 65101 65102 65011` in route-map 
    * Manipulate MED: `set metric #` in route-map 
    * Manipulate origin: `set origin <igp>` in route-map
    * Manipulate AS-Path 
      * private-as: `neighbor 10.4.4.4 remove-private-as`
      * local-as: `neighbor 10.4.4.4 local-as 300`
      * allow-as-in: `neighbor 10.4.4.4 allowas-in`
      * as-override: `neighbor 10.4.4.4 as-override`
    * Manipulate next-hop `set ip next-hop` in route-map 
  * 1.5.c ii Conditional advertisement
    * Conditional Route Advertisement 
      * Uses two route-maps, the `advertise-map` and the `[ exist-map | non-exist-map ]` 
      * RM-ADVERTISE -> advertise or don't advertise these routes based on the exist/non-exist map
      * RM-EXIST-MAP -> *IF* these routes exist in BGP table *THEN* advertise the routes in the advertise-map 
      * RM-NON-EXIST-MAP -> *IF* these routes do not exist in the BPG table *THEN* advertise the routes in the advertise-map 
    * Conditional Route Injection
      * Insert *more specific* prefixes into BGP without having them in the routing table 
      * Uses two route-maps, like conditional advertisement, but different, `inject-map` and `[ exist-map | non-exist-map ]`
        * RM-INJECT -> the routes to be injected 
          * *must have set ip address command*
        * RM-EXIST -> the summary routes must be learned from these peers (BGP router ID)
          * *must have the match ip route-source* 
          * *must also match ip address*
      * Configure 3 prefix-lists
        * PL-AGGREGATE -> these routes must exist to inject the more specific routes 
        * PL-LEARNED-FROM -> I needed to have learned the aggregated routes from these BGP speakers 
        * PL-INJECT -> the routes to inject    
      * Example: 
      ```
      router bgp 65101
        bgp inject-map RM-INJECT exist-map RM-LEARNED-FROM
        bgp neighbor 10.7.7.7 prefix-list PL-INJECT out
        !
      ip prefix-list PL-INJECT seq 5 permit 192.168.10.0/24
      ip prefix-list PL-INJECT seq 10 permit 192.168.11.0/24
      !
      ip prefix-list PL-LEARNED-FROM seq 5 permit 192.168.0.1/32
      !
      ip prefix-list PL-AGGREGATE seq 5 permit 192.168.0.0/16
      !
      route-map RM-INJECT permit 10
        set ip address prefix-list PL-INJECT
        !
      route-map RM-EXIST permit 10
        match ip address prefix-list PL-AGGREAGTE
        match ip route-source prefix-list PL-LEARNED-FROM
      ``` 
  * 1.5.c iii Outbound Route Filtering
    * `capability orf`
    * Tell neighbor which routes to advertise to you
    * Create a prefix list 
    * Configure `neighbor 10.5.5.5 capability orf prefix-list [ send | receive | both ]`
      * Send - advertise ORF send capabilities
      * Receive - advertise ORF receive capabilities
      * Both - advertise both capabilities 
    * Set the prefix list 
      * `neighbor 10.5.5.5 prefix-list ORF [ in | out ]`
  * 1.5.c iv Standard and extended communities
    * Tag routes 
    * Standards are 32-bit
    * Extendeds are 64-bit
    * Not sent by default 
      * `neighbor <neighbor> send-community`
      * `neighbor <neighbor> send-community extended`
    * Well-defined: 
      * no-advertise: do not advertise routes to any peer
      * no-export: do not advertise routes to any *real* eBGP peer
      * local-as: do not avertise this route to any eBGP peers 
      * internet: advertise this route to the intenret community 
    * Two parts: 
      * higher-order - AS number of AS that defines community meaning
      * Low-rder - local significance 
    * Manipulate them with route-maps
      * `set community 100:300`
      * `set community no-export`
    * Use lists of them 
      * `ip community-list expanded <name> permit 10:300`
      * Then, in route-map `match community <name>`
  * 1.5.c v Multi-homing
* 1.5.d AS path manipulations
  * 1.5.d i local-AS, allowas-in, remove-private-as
    * `local-as` - set your local ASN to something different than what's in the router process for a neighbor
    * `allowas-in` - allow you own AS inbound in the AS_PATH 
    * `remove-private-as` - strip private ASNs before advertising path 
  * 1.5.d ii Prepend
    * Make it seem like it's longer to get to you
    * `set aspath prepend`
  * 1.5.d iii Regexp
    * `.` - any character, including whitespace
    * `*` - 0 or more sequence of pattern
    * `+` - 1 or mote sequence of pattern 
    * `?` - 0 or 1 occurence of pattern
    * `^` - beginning of string
    * `$` - end of string 
    * `_` - any delimiter (beginning, end, space, tab, comma)
    * `\` - escape special character
    * `[]` - range 
    * `()` - pattern
    * `|` - OR 
    * `ip as-path access-list # permit <regex>`
* 1.5.e Convergence and scalability
  * 1.5.e i Route reflector
    * Used in iBGP to not need full mesh 
    * Set neighbor as `route-reflector-client` on RR 
    * Can be per-address-family 
    * By default, all RRs are in their own clusters, based on BGP router-id 
      * Use the cluster-id command to put multiple in a single cluster 
    * Downside - RR advertises its best path, which may not be the best path for the dreceiving router 
      * advertise more paths:
      ```
      router bgp 65101
        address-family ipv4 unicast
          bgp additional-paths {send [ receive ] | receive }
          bgp additional-paths select group-best
          bgp additional-paths select best <number>
          bgp additional-paths select all
          neighbor 10.3.3.3 advertise additional-paths [ best <number> ] [ group-best ] [ all ] 
      ```
  * 1.5.e ii Aggregation, as-set
    * `aggregate-address`
      * Put this right in the router or AF configuration 
        * `aggreagte-address 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0` and see it pop in when there's a component route in the BGP RIB 
      * Don't advertise the component routes: `aggregate-address <subnet> <mask> summary-only`
      * This could cause loops, best to preserve the as-path 
    * `aggregate-address <prefix> <mask> summary-only as-set`
      * Put all the AS's in the AS_PATH as a set to prevent loops
      * They will show up as [10,30,30] in the AS_PATH in `show ip bgp`
    * Now, control which AS_PATHs end up in the as-set: 
      * `aggregate-address <prefix> <mask> summary-only as-set advertise-map ROUTE-MAP`
        * route-map matches routes as specified
        * only routes that match the route-map end up in the AS_PATH 
    * Now, for more stupid router tricks, lets say you want to advertise the summary and only *some* of the component routes
      * Use a suppress-map to match routes to suppress
      * `aggregate-address <prefix> <mask> suppress-map ROUTE-MAP`
    * `attribute-map` - put some attributes on that aggregate! 
      * `aggregate-address <prefix> <mask> attribute-map ROUTE-MAP`
    * One final stupid router trick: an `unsupress-map`
      * You can use an unsupress-map *per neighbor* to unsupress routes from the aggregate to a specific neighbor
      * `neighbor 10.4.4.4 unsupress-map ROUTE-MAP`
* 1.5.f Other BGP features
  * 1.5.f i Multipath, add-path
    * Multipath -> toward FIB
    * `maximum-paths eibgp 6`
    * `maximum-paths ibgp #`
    * `bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax`
    * Add-path -> toward neighbors 
    ```
    address-family ipv4 unicast
     bgp additional-paths <send [ receive ] | receive>
     ! optionally per neighbor, 
     neighbor 10.3.3.3 additional-paths <send [ recieve ] | receive>
     bgp additional-paths select group-best
     bgp additional-paths select best number
     bgp additional-paths select all 
    ``` 
  * 1.5.f ii Soft reconfiguration, Route Refresh
    * Soft reconfiguration - keep a local-rib-in available to see for the peer `soft-reconfiguration inbound`
      * View with `sh ip bgp nei <neighbor> received-routes`
    * Route Refresh - signal to neighbor to ask for a new copy of routes `clear ip bgp <nei> in`
