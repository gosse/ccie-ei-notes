## 1.6 Multicast

### Acronym Soup

* LHR - Last Hop Router
* FHR - First Hop Router
* Sender/Source
* Receiver
* SSM - Source Specific Multicast
* ASM - Any Source Multicast 
* PIM-SM - Sparse Mode
* PIM-DM - Dense Mode
* Sparse-Dense Mode
* IGMP - Internet Group Management Protocol
* MLD - Multicast Listener Discovery
* RPF - Reverse Path Forwarding

* Multicast routing is the "opposite" of unicast, it routes away from the source
* A tree is created from FROM the *destination* TO the *source*. 
  * This is the SPT - shortest path tree 
  * In some cases, e.g., for BiDir and ASM, a shared tree is used, hinged on the RP (SPT source to RP, dest to RP)
    * After multicast begins flowing, it switches to the shortest path tree SPT - called SPT switchover
  * SPT is not great for many:many multicast, something like BiDir is a much better solution in that case. 
    * Why is not good? It doesn't scale. If you have have (S,G) for every pair of sender and receiver, your tables will fill up fast. With BiDir, you just have (\*,G), BUT all the traffic goes through the RP. 
* A single copy of traffic is sent, intermediate routers and switches duplicate as needed. 
* 224.0.0.0/4 is IPv4 multicast range 
* ff00::/12 is IPv6 multicast range
 

### 1.6.a Layer 2 multicast

* Layer 2 (in Ethernet networks) and Layer 3 have some multicast overlap. 
* 24-bit prefix 01:05:5e is reserved for multicast - this means only 23 bits leftover for the address. 
* IPv4 addresses are 32 bits. All mcast starts with 1110 (224.0.0.0/4), so each address has 28 unique bits
* This creates a 32:1 overlap 
* The mapping starts from the end, so overlapped addresses will all look very similar: 
  * 224.1.1.1
  * 224.129.1.1
  * 225.1.1.1
  * 225.129.1.1
  * ...
  * 239.1.1.1


#### 1.6.a i IGMPv2, IGMPv3

* IGMP is the Internet Group Management protocol, used for host to LHR communication. It is how hosts communicate they want to join multicast groups. 
* IGMPv2 standard for most things, IGMPv3 brings some new features, like Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), immediate join, and immediate leave. IMGPv2 enabled by default on Cisco routers. 
* Receiver sends Membership Report message to LHR, which then sends a PIM join to other routers up the tree. 
* LHR can do IGMPv2 to IGMPv3 mappings if the client doesn't support IGMPv3 


#### 1.6.a ii IGMP Snooping, PIM Snooping

* RFC 4541
* IGMP Snooping
  * IGMP snooping is Layer 2 switches watching IGMP *membership report* messages and keeping track which hosts are subscribed to which feeds for flooding traffic. 
  * If not enabled, BUM (broadcast, unknown unicast, multicast) traffic is flooded on all ports in the VLAN 
  * Enabled by Default 
  * `Switch(config)# [no] ip igmp snooping`
  * IGMP Snooping Querier 
    * IGMP snooping querier is used in a VLAN where PIM and IGMP are not configured because multicast traffic does not need to be routed. 
      * `Switch(config)# int vlan [VLAN ID]`
      * `Switch(config)# ip igmp snooping querier `
* PIM Snooping 
  * Requires IGMP snooping 
  * Used when a switch is between routers 
  * Forwards multicast to ports based on snooping PIM messages 
  * `Switch(config)# [no] ip pim snooping `


#### 1.6.a iii IGMP Querier

* A single router on a shared segment is elected to be the active querier. 
  * Router with lowest IP address become the querier 
  * This is not the same as the IGMP snooping querier.

#### 1.6.a iv IGMP Filter


* Filter IGMP joins by port 
* IOS-XE
  * `ip igmp filter #`
    * `#` is an igmp profile 
    * IGMP profiles are a bit like route-maps 

      ```
      Switch(config)# ip igmp profile 3
      Switch(config-igmp-profile)# permit
      Switch(config-igmp-profile)# range 229.9.9.0
      Switch(config-igmp-profile)# range 231.0.0.0 232.0.0.0
      Switch(config-igmp-profile)# exit
      Switch(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/1
      Switch(config-if)# ip igmp filter 1
      ```

* IOS Classic
  * Do it with snooping

  ```
  ip igmp snooping access-group <acl> [vlan <vlan_id>]
  ip access-list standard no-mcast-for-you
  deny ip 229.0.0.0 0.0.0.255
  permit ip any any
  ```

#### 1.6.a v MLD

* Two versions, MLDv1, MLDv2
  * MLDv2 required for all IPv6 nodes 
  * Includes source-specific multicast filters, only accepted sources and all sources except specified. 
* Uses ICMPv6 
* Message types: 
  * Query - Router asks for listeners 
  * Report - Listeners report themselves 
  * Done - Listeners say they're done 


* MLD Snooping 
  * Disabled by default globally, enabled on all VLANs by default
    * VLAN config overrides global 
    * When you enable it globally, it enables it on all VLANs 
  * Enable, `Device(config)# ipv6 mld snooping` -> then reload (???) 
  * Per-VLAN config, `Device(config)# ipv6 mld snooping vlan 1`

### 1.6.b Reverse path forwarding check

* RPF check makes sure we don't have routing loops
* `show ip rfp <prefix>`

### 1.6.c PIM

* Protocol Independent Multicast 
* PIM Assert 
  * If two LHR are on the same segment, only one is in a ofrwarding state 
  * `# show ip mroute` will use the 'A' flag to show which 
  * LHRs send PIM Assert messages for election - in a tie, lower IP address wins 
    * Information included -> route metrics, metric preference (AD), IP address 
  * Does not prevent duplicate multicast from occuring, use duplicates to trigger 
    * PIM Assert sent out when multicastcast packet is received on interface in OIL

#### 1.6.c i Sparse Mode

* This is a "pull" technology, receiver sends IGMP to LHR, which sends PIM join toward RP or source. 
* Compare with dense mode, which is flood and prune

#### 1.6.c ii Static RP, BSR, AutoRP

* For ASM, you need a RP to hookup senders and receivers. 
* Static RP is easy, but has to be statically configured everywhere. 
* AutoRP is a Cisco-proprietary mechanism for electing an RP dynamically
  * IPv4 only
  * Rarely used 
  * AutoRP uses two things, Mapping Agent and candidate RP 
    * Mapping agent receivers RP announcements and picks a winner 
    * Candidate RP sends out messages saying it wants to be an an RP (224.0.1.40)
    * Uses dense mode to flood group-to-RP mapping information to all PIM routers 
    * 224.0.1.39 - AUTO-RP-ANNOUNCE - RP mapping agents listen for candidate announcements 
    * 224.0.1.40 - AUTO-RP-DISCOVERY - RP mapping agents to discover candidates
    * Configure candidate RP: `ip pim send-rp-announce lo0 scope 16 interval 10`
    * Configure mapping agent: `ip pim send-rp-discovery lo0 scope 16`

* BSR is the industry standard mechanism for electing and RP dynamically 
  * IPv4 and IPv6 
  * de facto standard 
  * BSR -> bootstrap router. BSRs floods bootstrap messages and listens for them, the one with highest priority becomes BSR. All routers in domain learn it is the BSR 
    * `ip pim bsr-candidate lo0`
  * Candidate RP -> send unicast of its own address and configured groups to the BSR. BSR will learn every RP/group and floods RP to group mapping, every 60 seconds. 
    * `ip pim rp-candidate lo0`
    * Hash-mask-length - used to tie-break multiple candidates
   

#### 1.6.c iii Group to RP Mapping

* Either done statically, through AutoRP or BSR 
* `show ip pim rp`

#### 1.6.c iv Bidirectional PIM

* Good for many:many multicast environments
* All traffic goes through RP 
* Can be enabled selectively by group: 
  * `ip pim rp-addr 10.0.160.10 override bidir`

#### 1.6.c v Source-Specific Multicast

* No RP needed, the receiver knows the sender's IP 
* Default range is 232.0.0.0/8
* Requires IGMPv3 on host and LHR 

#### 1.6.c vi Multicast boundary, RP announcement filter
#### 1.6.c vii PIMv6 Anycast RP
#### 1.6.c viii IPv4 Anycast RP using MSDP

* Uses normal anycast for reachability
* Uses  MSDP to sync S,G 
* `# ip msdp originator-id lo0` and `# ip msdp peer 10.255.255.5 connect-souce lo0`


#### 1.6.c ix Multicast multipath
