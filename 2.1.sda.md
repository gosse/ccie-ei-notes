## 2.0 Software Defined Infrastructure 

### 2.1 Cisco SD Access

* 2.1.a Design a Cisco SD Access solution
  * 2.1.a i Underlay network (IS-IS, manual/PnP)
  * 2.1.a ii Overlay fabric design (LISP, VXLAN, Cisco TrustSec)
  * 2.1.a iii Fabric domains (single-site and multi-site using SD-WAN transit)
    * A fabric domain includes one or more fabric sites with a transit network
    * A fabric domain is managed by a single DNAC cluster
    * No end-to-end segmentation between fabric domains 
    * Transit network types: 
      * IP-based (VRF-Lite, MPLS, remap VRFs and SGTs between sites)
        * Good idea when sites in different regions
        * Good idea when organizations already have an existing WAN 
      * SD-Access Transit (VXLAN, SGT, domain-wide CP node) 
        * Good idea if we have dark fiber/DWDM
        * Good idea within Metro area 
        * Good idea when you have higher MTU support 
      * SD-WAN Transit (Carries context info in SD-WAN encap)
        * Good idea if you have SD-WAN 
        * Good idea when you're cross-segion 
* 2.1.b Cisco SD Access deployment
  * 2.1.b i Cisco DNA Center device discovery and device management
  * 2.1.b ii Add fabric node devices to an existing fabric
  * 2.1.b iii Host onboarding (wired endpoints only)
  * 2.1.b iv Fabric border handoff
* 2.1.c Segmentation
  * 2.1.c i Macro-level segmentation using VNs
  * 2.1.c ii Micro-level segmentation using SGTs (using Cisco ISE)
* 2.1.d Assurance
  * 2.1.d i Network and client health (360)
  * 2.1.d ii Monitoring and troubleshooting
