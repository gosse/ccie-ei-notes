### 2.2 Cisco SD-WAN

#### 2.2.a Design a Cisco SD-WAN solution
* 2.2.a i Orchestration plane (vBond, NAT)
  * vBond must be publically addressable (1:1 NAT is fine)
  * Orchestrates edge onboarding and bring-up 
  * WAN Edge can know about vBond via PnP, ZTP, boostrap config or static config 
  * On vEdge: `show orchestrator connections` and `show orchestrator connection-history`
  * STUN used to discover NAT types 
  * NAT 
    * Full-cone (1:1 or static)  - address and port always open 
    * Symmetric NAT (most common, dynamic PAT) - original source IP translated to outside IP, port translated
      * External hosts cannot initiate connections 
    * Address Restricted Cone NAT - like symmetric, but allows external hosts to communicate to internal host on ANY port if internal host has communicated with external previously 
    * Port Restricted CONE NAT - only can talk to external host on port that it's already used 
  * Problematic NAT pairs 
    * When Symmetric, Address Restricted, and Port Restricted are both involved on each side
      * Symmetric to {Symmetric, Port-restricted, Address-restricted}
      * Port-restricted to {Symmetric, Port-restricted, Address-restricted}
      * Address-restricted to {Symmetric, Port-restricted, Address-restricted}
* 2.2.a ii Management plane (vManage)
  * SD-WAN NMS 
  * Can be high scalable in a cluster 
* 2.2.a iii Control plane (vSmart, OMP)
  * vSmart is similar to BGP RR 
  * Distributes OMP TLOC updates to/from Edges 
    * Lots of policy done in/out of vSmart to do things like influence traffic, create hub/spoke, etc. 
  * Uses DTLS/TLS (initial port of 12346, but distributed to other ports to distribute across cores)
* 2.2.a iv Data plane (vEdge/cEdge)
  * cEdges are goofy, vEdge feels natural 
  * No IKE keys (yay), OMP takes care of that shit 
  * Pairwise keys can be used, but key exchange still happens on vSmart 
  * PMTU discovery happens via BFD 
    * But uses a decent amount of bandwidth, so turn it off on low-bandwidth links
#### 2.2.b WAN edge deployment
* 2.2.b i Onboarding new edge routers
* 2.2.b ii Orchestration with zero-touch provisioning/Plug-And-Play
* 2.2.b iii OMP
  * OMP 
    * Facilties network communication within fabric
    * Advertises service availability and location 
    * Distributes data plane security info, including encryption keys 
    * Best-path selection and routing advertisements 
  * GRES enabled 
    * Default time is 12 hours that vSmart can be offline (max 7 days) 
    * You need valid IPSec keys during GRES period, so best practice is make your IPSec rekey timer 2x the GRES time 
    * 3 types of routes 
      * OMP Routes (vRoutes)
        * Network prefix
        * OMP resolves 'next-hop' to a TLOC 
        * OMP routes include: NLRI, TLOC, origin (BGP/OSPF/conn/static) 
        * Originator - system IP of advertiser 
        * Preference (like local pref) 
        * Service 
        * Site ID 
        * Tag 
        * VPN 
        * Peer - indicates where the route was received from 
          * Always vSmart 
        * Status - C I R means "chosen, installed, resolved" (for a route to install, the TLOC must be resolvable) 
        * OMP routes have an AD of *250* in vEdge, *251* in cEdge 
      * TLOC
        * System IP 
        * Color
        * Encap 
        * TLOC private address
        * TLOC public address (determined with STUN) 
          * If private = public, _then_ device not behind NAT 
        * Preference (higher preferred) 
        * Site ID 
        * Tag 
        * Weight (only locally significant)
      * Service Routes
        * Identifies a network service to the SD-WAN overlay 
        * Firewall, IPS/IDS, something that can process traffic
        * Workflow:
          * Define service in feature template
          * WAN edges advertise services to vSmart
          * WAN edges advertise OMP and TLOC routes 
          * Network admin applies policy defining traffic to flow through these services
        * Service Route update information: 
          * VPN ID 
          * Service ID (FW = svc-id 1, IDS, IPS, netsvc1, netsvc2, netsvc3, netsvc4)
      * OMP BestPath
        * Valid OMP Route requried 
        * Locally sourced OMP 
        * Admin Distance (lower) 
        * OMP Pref (higher) 
        * TLOC Pref (higher) 
        * Origin (Conn>Static>EBGP>EIGRP internal>OSPF>OSPF IA>OSPF E>EIGRP Ext>iBGP>Unknown)
        * Origin metric (lowest) 
        * System IP (highest) 
        * TLOC private address (highest) 
        * vSmart can advertise upto 16 ECMP routes (default 4)
      * OMP Route Redistribution 
        * OSPF -> set down bit when advertising, just like MPLS vpnv4 
        * BGP -> SOO just like MPLS vpnv4 
        * EIGRP -> new feature! EIGRP *external protocol* set to _OMP-Agent_
          * When WAN edges receive update with these field set, they set "SD-WAN_Down" bit and sets the AD of the routes to 252 
          * This makes OMP routes at AD of 251 preferred 
* 2.2.b iv TLOC
  * Colors - separate out link types 
  * Private colors - use only when no NAT is in between devices in underlay
    * If colors are private colors, private IPs and ports will always be used for data plane connectivity
  * Public colors - use when NAT involved 
  * Public - 3g, biz-internet, public-internet, custom1-3, colors (blue, bronze, gold, green, red, silver)
  * Private - metro-e, MPLS, private1-6 
  * `restrict` attribute - OMP attribute
    * 1 = only form tunnels with TLOCs of the same color 
    * 0 = form tunnels with ALL colors (default) 
  * Tunnel Groups - only form tunnels with matching tunnel groups 
    * If using, best to use on all sites 
#### 2.2.c Configuration templates
* Feature Templates
  * Configure all the features (ha) of SD-WAN edges
  * System, VPNs, interfaces, NTP, OMP, routing, AAA, etc. 
* Device Templates
  * Combine feature templates and apply to devices 
#### 2.2.d Localized policies
* Traditional
  * Control 
    * route-maps
    * Manipulate route attributes or filter routes as they go from WAN edge to routing domain via OSPF/BGP/EIGRP
  * Data 
    * QoS 
    * ACL - filter, remark traffic
* Security 
  * Zone-based firewall
  * IPS 
  * URL 
  * AMP 
  * DNS 
#### 2.2.e Centralized policies
* vSmart must be in "vManage mode" to apply these 
* Two types, control and data 
* Control 
  * Control 
    * Prefer one site over another for traffic 
    * Limit which sites can build tunnels to other sites 
    * Have directionality, from vSmart's perpsective 
    * Inbound policies are applied before routes processed through best-path 
      * More global in nature 
    * Outbound policies applied after vest-path and limited to Site IDs listed in control plicy application 
      * Limited in target and scope 
    * *Remember: data plane tunnels are controlled by TLOC advertisement. If a WAN edge receives a TLOC from the vSmart, it will attempt to build a data plane tunnel to that TLOC and start BFD.*
  * VPN membership 
    * Limit distributing routing information about particular VPNs to sites (e.g., guest) 
* Data
  * Direction -> from-tunnel, from-service, all 
  * `show policy data-policy-filter`
  * `show policy from-vsmart`
  * `show policy service-path`
  * Centralized Data Policies
    * Policy-based routing (like DIA) 
    * Service insertion 
    * Data plane manipulation 
    * FEC 
  * AAR - application aware routing 
    * Route data based on SLA 
  * cflowd - Netflow 

 * Example policy - filter out TLOC of spokes to other spokes to make a Hub & Spoke network 
   * Create site lists for Hubs and Spokes 
   * Create a *Control* Policy 
     * TLOC sequence: 
       * Default Reject
       * TLOC *from* hubs -> accept 
     * Route Sequnce: 
       * Default reject
       * Site-List *Hubs* -> accept
    * Save, apply *outbound* _to_ *spokes*      
* Example policy - branch to branch traffic route via regional hub 
  * Solution A - summarization 
    * Build on hub-and-spoke centralized control policy above and advertise a summary route from the regional site 
  * Solution B - TLOC Lists 
    * Centralized control policies can be used to manipulate TLOC attributes in OMP 
      * Effectively, this changes the next-hop
    * Create TLOC list for *regional-DCs*
    * Create control policy:
      * TLOC sequence 
        * Default Reject
        * TLOC *from-site* _DCs_ *accept*    
      * Route sequence
        * Match site list *branches* accept 
          * Actions->TLOC->TLOC List *regional-DCs* 
      * Apply to *branches*, _outbound_
* You can do all these things per-VPN, by adding a "per VPN" match condition in your policy
