### 3.2 DMVPN

#### 3.2.a Troubleshoot DMVPN Phase 3 with dual-hub
* NBMA address = outside address
* MTU issues - best `ip mtu 1400` and `ip tcp adjust-mss 1360`
* 3.2.a i NHRP
  * NHRP is next-hop resolution protocol
  * Caches like ARP or reverse ARP 
  * Used in DMVPN to map tunnel IP to NBMA address 
  * Can have static and dynamic entries 
  * Hub: `ip nhrp network-id #` and `ip nhrp map multicast dynamic`
  * Spoke: `ip nhrp network-id #` and `ip nhrp nhs <tunnel IP> nbma <physical IP> multicast`
  * Phase 3 enabled with `ip nhrp redirect` on the hubs and `ip nhrp shortcut` on the spokes 
  * Make sure you have your IGP fucked correctly 
    * If EIGRP or OSPF, make sure you have multicast on the hub, `ip nhrp multicast dynamic` and the spokes, `ip nhrp map multicast <NBMA address>`
    * EIGRP 
      * next-hop-self default (fine) 
      * Can also summarize the routes 
      * `no ip split-horizon eigrp 100`
    * OSPF 
      * `ip ospf network point-to-multipoint` on hub and spokes 
    * iBGP 
      * `nei GROUP next-hop-self all`
  * `show ip nhrp`
  * `show ip nhrp nhs detail`
    * You can see NHS fails here, make sure your tunnel-key is right
  * `debug ip nhrp`
  * Sometimes, if spoke IP changes, it can cause an incorrect NHRP mapping in the hub 
    * Spoke router will show 'unique address registered already' 
    * ON SPOKE - `ip nhrp registration no-unique`
* 3.2.a ii IPsec/IKEv2 using pre-shared key
  * Configured with `tunnel protection ipsec profile PROFILE-NAME shared`
    * Make sured `shared` is configure on spokes too, if using dual-hub
  * Make sure this matches on hub/spoke 
  * IKEv2 - 
  ```
  crypto ipsec profile IPSE-PROFILE-NAME
    set transform-set TD-NAME 
    set ikev2-profile IKEV2-PROF-NAME
  ```
  * Keepalives can be a helper, add `crypto ike v2 <keepalive interval> <retry> [ on demand | periodic ]` as periodic if there's a firewall in the path 
  * With NAT in the middle, `crypto ikev2 nat keepalive <interval>` can help as well 
  * Classic crypto troubleshooting commands, 
    * `show crypto ikev2 sa detail`
    * `show crypto ipsec sa peer <IP>`
  * `show dmvpn detail`
  * Common issue - EZVPN and DMVPN on the same router 
    * `show crypto isakmp sa` and see "CONF_XAUTH" in state column
    * Separate EzVPN and DMVPN by using ISAKMP profiles 
    * Match EzVPN clients in "group name" and DMVPN spokes in "match identitity address" 
    ```
    crypto isakmp profile dmvpn
      keyring dmvpn
      match identity address 0.0.0.0
    crypto ipsec profile vpnprof
      set transform-set t2
      set isakmp-profile dmvpn 
    crypto isakmp profile remotevpn 
      match identity group vpnclient 
    crypto dynamic-map DMAP 10
      set transform-set t3 
      set isakmp-profile remotevpn
    ````
* 3.2.a iii Per-Tunnel QoS
  * this is pretty dope 
  * Have the spoke signal the hub which QoS policy to apply to it using an NHRP group 
  * Spoke: `(config-if)# nhrp group GROUPNAME`
  * Hub: `(config-if)# nhrp map group GROUPNAME service-policy output PMAP-NAME` (you will have a number of these)
  * Weirdness with port-channel, `platform qos port-channel-aggregate` if using a port-channel on the hub 
  * Verify: `show nhrp group-mape NAME`
    * `show policy-map multipoint tunnel 1`
    * `show tunnel endpoints`
#### 3.2.b Identify use-cases for FlexVPN
* Building blocks of FlexVPN: IKEv2 and tunnel interface config
* FlexVPN is "unofficially" DMVPN Phase 4 
* Uses VirtualTemplate tunnel interfaces to dynamically build tunnel interfaces (DVTI) 
  * `show derived interface Virtual-AccessX)`
  * Can also use Static VTI (SVTI) tunnels 
* FlexVPN supports standards-based IKEv2, including built-in mobile clients 
* If using PKI, you can use certificate fields to perform IKE request matching and authorization 
* Can use AAA to authenticate tunnels and send back VSAs with tunnel properties, like bandwidth references
* 3.2.b i Site-to-site, Server, Client, Spoke-to-Spoke
* 3.2.b ii IPsec/IKEv2 using pre-shared key
* 3.2.b iii MPLS over FlexVPN
  * I put labels in your FlexVPN
  * End-to-End VRF separatoin 
  * LDP Free - tunnels (virtual-access from virtualtemplates) create back-to-back links 
  * Or use LDP in the tunnel -> `(config-if)# mpls nhrp`
