### 4.1 Device Security on Cisco IOS XE

#### 4.1.a Control plane policing and protection
* Protect CPU/control plane
  * At a hardware level, applied ot the punt/inject interface
* Uses MQC and CPU queues, leveraging dedicated policers in hardware 
* On cat9k, only input policing is supported
* On cat9k, `system-cpp-policy` policy-map is available and only this map can be installed on the control plane interface
* If you remove a policer, e.g., `no police rate`, on the system-cpp-policy policy-map, it will be reinstated after a reboot 
* This policy-map won't show up in 'show run' unless modified
* Configure with a service-policy, like QoS, but not all matches suported (no NBAR)
  * Only two MQC commands supported: `police` and `set`
  * Match criteria suport: *standard and extended ACL*
  * Class-map matches supported: dscp, ip dscp, ip precedence, precedence, protocol arp, protocol ipv6, protocol pppoe, protocol pppoe-discovery, qos-group
* If you set a policer rate, it is converted to the nearest multiple of 200 
* Change back to default - `cpp system-default`
* Show stats: `show platform hardware fed switch 1 qos queue stats internal cpu policer`

#### 4.1.b AAA
* `aaa new-model` clears out your aaa settings 
* Supports sequences of lists, fallback if main source isn't available 
* Default lists vs explicitly assigned
* TACACS & RADIUS 
* Group servers into server groups, which can then be used in method lists 
* You can have the same server in a group, but it needs a unique port 
* Method lists: `aaa authentication <type> default group <NAME> group <NAME2> local`
  * default: default list (can also be any other name to call specifically)
  * type: ppp, enable, dot1x, login, webauth
  * NAME: list name 
  * NAME2: second list name, if all in first list fail
  * local: use local auth 
    * Can also be local-case, which is case-sensitive 
    * Can also be none, which will deny access if the servers can't be reached
* Authentication 
  * Apply AAA method list
  * vty: 
  ```
  line vty 0 15 
      aaa authentication login [default | listname ]
  ```
  * dot1x -> more in dot1x section 
      * ```aaa authentication dot1x [ default | list name ] group ...` and `dot1x system-auth-control`
  * Also, set a banner, `aaa authentication banner *Unauthorized Access Prohibited*`
  * Also, set a failure banner, `Device(config)# aaa authentication fail-message *Failed login, go home*`
* Authorization 
  * Authorization types - commands, exec, network, reverse access 
  * Methods - tacacs+, if-authenticated, none, local, radius 
  * `aaa authorization [ type ] [ default | group NAME ] [none]`
    * none -> grant all if authZ server not available 
  * Apply to line - `login authorization [ default | NAME ]`
* Accounting 
  * Types - network, exec, command, connection, system, resource 
  * Methods - radius, tacacs+ 
  * Configure: `aaa accounting network [ default | group NAME ] [ start-stop | stop-only ] group [ NAME ]`
* Can be done per VRF, vty can use `vrf-also`
* Different privilege levels (1-15) 
* RBAC - parser view
