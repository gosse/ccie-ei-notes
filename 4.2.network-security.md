### 4.2 Network Security

#### 4.2.a Switch security features
* 4.2.a i VACL, PACL
  * VACL: VLAN ACL 
    * Apply to VLAN, then applies to all ports in the VLAN, access and trunk
    * Inspect both IP and non-IP 
    * Be careful with implicit deny, may block STP and/or ARP 
    * Works more like a route-map than ACL 
      * Use ACLs to identify traffic, permit/deny with VACL 
    * `show vlan filter`
  * PACL: Port ACL 
    * Works inbound only 
    * Can be MAC or IP based 
      * MAC ACLs only impact non-IP traffic 
* 4.2.a ii Storm control
  * Don't let one poorly behaving detroy your network 
  * Hardware policer
  * Monitors packets passing from interface to switching bus, determines if packet is unicast, multicast, or broadcast 
  * Counts number within 1 second interval, compares to threshold set 
  * Can meaure in three way: 
    * % of interface bandwith
    * packets per second
    * bits per second
  * Block when rising threshold met, unblock below falling threshold
  * Configure on interface: `storm-control [ unicast | multicast | broadcast ] level [ rising ] [ falling ]`
    * Default is percentage. Change to pps and bps as needed
  * Configure action: `storm-control action [ shutdown | trap ]`
  * Display: `show storm-control gi2/0/3 unicast`
* 4.2.a iii DHCP Snooping, DHCP option 82
  * The first of the snooping, source guard, dia triad 
  * Prevent rogue dhcp servers 
  * Enforces DHCP roles on ports - only trusted ports may respond to DISCOVER 
  * Maintains IP/DHCP/MAC/Port binding list, which is then used for DIA and IP Source Guard 
  * Configure: `ip dhcp snooping` and `ip dhcp snooping vlan #`
  * Configure ports: `ip dhcp snooping trust`
  * Don't forget to trust the uplink/trunk port/port toward DHCP server 
  * By default, this inserts an empty giaddr field, which the IOS DHCP server can't handle
    * Disable this with `no ip dhcp snooping information-option`
  * Troubleshoot with
    * `debug dhcp detail`
    * `debug ip dhcp snooping`
    * `debug ip dhcp snooping event`
  * Option-82: "physical attachment" 
    * Supposed to be for distributed DHCP server/relay environments 
    * Has suboptions, like 'remote-id' and 'circuit-id'
    * Configure additional Option 82 values with `ip dhcp class`
  * If you have an aggregation switch, and the access-layer is downstream, it should be on an "unstruted port" 
    * The edge switch should be inserting option-82 information
    * You need `ip dhcp snooping information option allow-untrusted` to properly build the DHCP snooping database
* 4.2.a iv IP Source Guard
  * `ip device tracking` must be enabled
  * Prevent IP spoofing 
  * Configure on interface, `ip verify source`
  * Only IP-to-MAC maping is allowed on that particular port 
  * Combine with port-security to do MAC filtering 
  * You will need to deal with static IPs with `ip source binding`
* 4.2.a v Dynamic ARP Inspection
  * Prevent ARP poisoning 
  * Configure `ip arp inspection vlan #`
  * Without DHCP snooping, you will need an arp access-list,
  ```
  arp access-list # 
    permit ip host <IP> mac host <MAC>
  ip arp inspection filter # VLAN #
  ```
  * Trust your switch-to-switch links: `ip arp inspection trust` 
* 4.2.a vi Port Security
  * Port access based on MAC address
  * A secure MAC can only belong to one port 
    * static - set staticly
    * sticky - learned and inserted into running-config ofr that port 
    * dynamic - learned dynamically, not perserved after reboot
  * Violation modes: 
    * shutdown - err-disable port
    * protect - allow traffic from allowed macs, filter out all other
    * restrict - allow valid macs in, filter out all other, send snmp trap
  ```
  int gi1/0/1
    switchport port-security mac-addres sticky
    switchport port-security violation [ shutdown | protect | restrict ]
  ```
* 4.2.a vii Private VLAN
  * L2 isolation within a VLAN 
  * Can extend through multiple switches 
  * Requires VLAN in a VLAN 
  * Types: primary, secondary['community', 'isolated']
  * Port types: promiscuous, host 
  * Primary VLAN - carries traffic from promiscuous ports to host ports 
  * Isolated VLAN - carries traffic from host ports to promiscuous ports 
  * Community VLAN - carries traffic between community host ports and promiscuous ports
  * VTPv3 can carry this informatoin 
  * Configuration:
  ```
  vlan 10 
    name primary-vlan
    private-vlan primary 
  vlan 2000
    name isolated-hosts
    privte-vlan isolated
  vlan 3000
    name community-hosts
    private-vlan community
  vlan 10 
    ! come back here and associate the others
    private-vlan association add 2000,3000
  int gi1/0/1
    ! needs two configs
    switchport mode private-vlan host 
    switchport private-vlan host-associate 10 2000 ! note the primary and secondary are both defined
  ```

#### 4.2.b Router security features
* 4.2.b i IPv6 Traffic Filters
  * Only named ACLs(!)
  * Reflexive ACLs not supported(!)
  * No wildcard mask(!!!!!)
  * MAC-based ACLs not supported/applied on IPv6 frames
  * Layer 3 and 4
  * Apply with 'traffic-filter' command
  ```
  ipv6 access-list no_beef
    deny 2001:beef:beef:beef::/64 any
  int gi1
    ipv6 traffic-filter no_beef in
* 4.2.b ii IPv4 Access Control Lists
  * Standard 1-99, 1300-1999, named
    * Layer 3 only 
  * Extended 100-199, 2000-2699, named
    * Layer 3 and 4 
    * Match IP options, like dscp/ipp
  * You can use time ranges
    * absolute - one time 
    * periodic - recurring 
    ```
    time-range TIMERANGE
      period weekdays 09:00 to 17:00
    ip access-list ext testing123sibiliance
      permit ip any any time-range TIMERANGE
    ```
  * Traffic Filtering -> `ip access-group`
  * Traffic Classification -> `match access-group`
  * Route Filtering -> lots of ways 
  * VTY - `access-class NAME [in|out]`
  * Object Groups
    * Use these for re-using same groups of IP addresses 
    * Types: network, security, service, v6-network, v6-service
* 4.2.b iii Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding
  * Don't let traffic in an interface unless that's the RPF for that interface
  * Strict -> reverse route must be via ingress interface
  * Loose -> reverse route may be via any interface 
    * This is useful on an internet edge will possible asymmetric routing
  * You can use an ACL to provide exceptions
    * `ip verify unicast source reachable-via rx ACL-RPF`
    * _Violating_ packets will be checked against the ACL. 
    * You can use a deny/log to see results 
    * You can permit/deny as needed
  * This will not allow the default route to pass the RPF check: `ip verify unicast source reachable-via rx allow-default`
  * `ipv6 verify unicast source reachable-via rx`


#### 4.2.c IPv6 infrastructure security features
* Protip: if/when you configure IPv4 and IPv6 source guard on the same interface, use `ip verify source mac-check` not `ip verify source`
  * IPv4 traffic might break if you don't 
* IPv6 snooping was required for this to work, but is deprecated 
  * Use the Switch Integrated Security Feature (SISF)-based Device Tracking feature instead.
  * `ipv6 snooping policy NAME`
  * Snooping Policy has a whole shitload of options, 
    * device-role
    * limit address-count
    * protocol ( dhcp | ndp )
    * security-level 
      * glean - populate binding table without verification
      * guard - glean and inpsection, rject RA and DHCP server messages (default) 
      * inspect - glean, validates, enforces address ownership 
    * tracking ( disable | enable )
    * trusted-port 
  * Apply policies to ports, you need `(config-if)# ipv6 snooping` to attach default 
    * Attach one of your policies with `ipv6 snooping attach-policy NAME`
* 4.2.c i RA Guard
  * Prevent router spoofing and prefix spoofing 
  * VLAN or port level 
  * Drops RA messages from non-router facing interfaces 
  * Use a nd raguard policy and attach with `ipv6 raguard attach-policy NAME`
* 4.2.c ii DHCP Guard
  * Prevents DHCPv6 server spoofing 
  * VLAN or port level 
  * Create a policy with `ipv6 dhcp guard policy NAME`
  * Attach with `ipv6 dhcp guard attach-policy NAME`
* 4.2.c iii Binding table
  * Configure: `ipv6 neighbor binding`
  * You can create a static entry 
  * `sho ipv6 neighbor binding`
* 4.2.c iv Device tracking
  * Configure `device-tracking` on interface and/or VLAN 
  * `show device-tracking policy default`
  * Create your own policy if you'd like 
  * `device-tracking policy NAME`
    * data-glean: learn addresses from source inside network 
    * destination-glean: populate binding table by gleaning traffic stination address
    * device-role ( node | switch ) 
    * limit # 
    * prefix-glean: learn prefixes from RA or DHCP-PD 
    * protocol ( arp | dhcp4 | dhcp6 | ndp )
    * security-level ( glean | guard | inspect )
      * glean - passive
      * guard - inspect and drop unauthorized
      * inspect - glean and validate, no drop 
    * tracking ( enable | disable )
    * trusted-port
  * Attach to interface: `device-tracking attach-policy NAME`
* 4.2.c v ND Inspection/Snooping
  * Also uses policies
  * Configure: `ipv6 nd inspection policy NAME`, t
    * Options: 
      * device-role ( switch | host ) 
      * limit address-count
      * tracking ( enable | disable ) 
      * trusted-port
      * validate source-mac 
  * Apply to an interface with `(config-if)# ipv6 nd inspection attach-policy NAME`
* 4.2.c vi Source Guard
  * Relies on IPv6 snooping tale to create IPv6 neighbor binding table 
  * Like everything else in this section, create a policy and apply to an interface
  * `ipv6 source-guard policy NAME`
    * `deny global-autoconf` -> use to deny traffic from auto-configured global addresses. Useful if you want to make sure all addresses are DHCP-assigned
  * Apply to interface, `ipv6 source-guard attach-policy NAME`

#### 4.2.d IEEE 802.1X Port-Based Authentication
* 4.2.d i Device roles, port states
  * Switch is an intermediary, speaking EAP to the client and RADIUS to the AuthN server 
  * Port states
    * unauthorized
    * authorized 
* 4.2.d ii Authentication process
* 4.2.d iii Host modes
  * multi-auth: allow multiple authenitcated clients on data VLAN and voice VLAN 
  * multi-host: allow multiple hosts after a single host has been authenticated
  * multi-domain: allow one host and one voice device
