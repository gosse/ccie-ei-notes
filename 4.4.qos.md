### Background

* IntServ with RSVP is another way of doing QoS, which opens a path between two endpoints, reserving bandwidth 
  * This adds a lot of state to the network and doesn't scale well 
  * Every intermediate router has to process the control plane 
  * Does not scale well 
* Enter DiffServ and PHB 

### 4.4.a End to end L3 QoS using MQC

#### 4.4.a i DiffServ

* Each router makes independent forwarding decision on QoS (per-hop) 
* Scales really well for forwarding
* Pain in the ass to keep configuration consistent 
* DiffServ uses a 6-bit DSCP, the first 6 bits of the 1-byte differentiated services (DS) field in an IPv4 header
* DiffServ uses the first 6 bits of the 1-byte traffic class field in an IPv6 header
* No end-to-end signaling, therefore, per-hop behavior (PHB) 
* Service Categories: 
  * DF - default forwarding -> best effort
  * AF - assured forwarding -> "enhanced" best effort
    * That is, in times of congestion, a candidate for controlled drops 
  * EF - expedited forwarding ->  sensitive to latency/jitter/loss
  * CS - class selector -> backward compatible with IP Precedence 
    * Many apps use legacy marking and diffserv fits them in 
* RFC 4594 is THE resource for this (and easy to read)

#### 4.4.a ii CoS and DSCP Mapping
#### 4.4.a iii Classification

* Classification and marking happens at the QoS Trust boundary 
* Usually, this is at the access-layer, host-facing ports 
  * You can have conditional trust, trusting some endpoints (e.g., IP Phones) and not others (computers) 
  * Ideal as close to the endpoints as possible, sometimes done at other places 
* Match criteria (general ACLs or NBAR) and mark using traffic classes 
* MQC uses ACLs, class-maps, and policy-maps to accomplish this

```
ip access-list extended ACL-SSH 
 permit tcp any any eq 22

class-map CLASS-SSH
 match access-group name ACL-SSH ! ACL method 
 match protocol ssh ! NBAR method

policy-map PMAP-MARK-SSH 
 class CLASS-SSH 
 set dscp CS2
 
int gi0
 service-policy PMAP-MARK-SSH input
```

#### 4.4.a iv Network Based Application Recognition (NBAR)

* NBAR lets you match protocols instead of IP/port (see example above) 
* Uses more resources than ACLs 
* Does not work in MPLS tunnels
* Classification tool 
* Must be enable on an interface first 
  * `ip nbar protocol-discovery [ipv6|ipv4]`
* Check on matches: 
  * `show policy-map interface <gi0/0/0>`
  * `show ip nbar protocol-discovery top-n 5`


#### 4.4.a v Marking using IP Precedence, DSCP, CoS

* Mark after classifying 
* Do it in your policy map
 
```
policy-map PMAP-MARK-SSH 
 class CLASS-SSH 
 set dscp CS2 ! DSCP 
 set cos 2 ! CoS 
 set precedence 7 ! IP Precedence 
```

TODO: learn more CoS and IPP

* Sometimes you need to translate from one QoS type to another
* You can use these to transform QoS markings of the same type (e.g., DSCP to DSCP)  
* Do this with a table-map, if the default don't suit you. 
* Default CoS to DSCP: 

| CoS | DSCP |
| --- | ---- | 
| 0   | 0    |
| 1   | 8    |
| 2   | 16   |
| 3   | 24   | 
| 4   | 32   |
| 5   | 40   |
| 6   | 48   | 
| 7   | 46   | 

* Default IP Precedence to DSCP Map 

| Precedence | DSCP | 
| ---------- | ---- |
| 0          | 0 |
| 1          | 8 |
| 2          | 16 |
| 3          | 24 |
| 4          | 32 |
| 5          | 40 |
| 6          | 48 |
| 7          | 56 |

* Default DSCP to CoS Map 

| DSCP | CoS |
| ---- | --- | 
| 0-7  | 0 |
| 8-15 | 1 |
| 16-23 | 2 |
| 24-31 | 3 |
| 32-39 | 4 |
| 40-47 | 5 |
| 48-55 | 6 | 
| 56-63 | 7 |

#### 4.4.a vi Policing, shaping

* Policing 
 * CIR - committed information rate, if excceded, drop or lower in queue
 * Bc - maximum amount of contiguous packets in a single "batch" -> this is because AR and CIR do not match 
 * Be - optional, can be used to improve admission control fairness, allows you to build up credit with bucket system 
 * `Tc = Bc/CIR` -> this time inetrval is known as metering "averaging interval" 
   * Time window to county bytes for finding the average rate 
 * Three Techniques: 
 	* Single rate, two-color (1 token bucket) 
 	  * TODO: explain
 	* Single rate, three-color (2 token buckets)
 	  * TODO: explain
 	* Dual rate, three-color (2 token buckets)
 	  * TODO: explain 
* Shaping = queueing and scheduling (kind of) 
  * Prepare traffic to be policed 
  * Slow down traffic by queueing before egress
* Low latency queue (LLQ) - send first 
  * not a strict prioirty queue, if traffic exceeds threshold, it will not get LLQ treatment 
  * TODO: priority 1, priority 2 

#### 4.4.a vii Congestion management and avoidance

* Admission control - air traffic control to let traffic on the network 
  * E.g., if only enough banwidth provisionined for 5 phone calls, don't let the 6th phone make a call, have the phone system reject it 
* AQM - Active Queue Management 
  * WRED 
  * Don't use on inelastic traffic 
* ECN - can be used with AQM 
  * Last two bits of ToS/traffic class field 
  * If last two bits are 00, client does not support ECN, just do WRED 
  * If last two bits 01 or 10, ECN enabled (negotiated between client and server) 
  * If last two bits 11, congestion signaled - tells endpoint there is congestion and signals back pressure 
  * Dishonest clients can abuse 

#### 4.4.a viii HQoS, Sub-rate Ethernet Link

* Hierarchical QoS (HQoS) lets us put a service-policy inside a service-policy  
  * The parent traffic policy only supports the traffic class of class-default 
  * "Hierarchical shaping is only supported for the port shaper, where for the parent you only have a configuration for the class default, and the only action for the class default is shaping." - Quality of Service Configuration Guide, Cisco IOS XE Gibraltar 16.12.x (Catalyst 9300 Switches)
  * Put the bandwidth in bytes?bits? in the parent, percentages in the child
