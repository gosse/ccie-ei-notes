### 4.5 Network Services

#### 4.5.a First-Hop Redundancy Protocols
* 4.5.a i HSRP, GLBP, VRRP
  * HSRP 
    * Elects active gateway based on priority
    * Highest physical IP is tiebreaker 
    * Non-preemptive by default 
    * UDP multicast to all routers (224.0.0.2) port 1985 
    * Authentication with cleartext or MD5 
    * v2 default, has v3 as well 
  * GLBP 
    * 224.0.0.102 udp/3222
    * Cisco proprietary 
    * Each FHR can actively forward traffic and be an "Active Virtual Forwader" AVF 
    * One of the gateways is the "Active Virtual Gateway" AVG and is the one that responds to ARP with AVF IPs 
    * AVG elected on priority, no preemption by default 
    * Enable load balancing with `glbp group # load-balancing weighted` 
      * Assign weights with `glbp # weighting #` 
  * VRRP
    * Preemptive by default 
    * IP protocol 112 on 224.0.0.18
    * Higher priority wins  
  * All FHRPs are able to use tracking objects to modify operational state
    * This lets us flip active gateway based on uplink availability 
    * HSRP: `standby group # track # decrement #`
* 4.5.a ii Redundancy using IPv6 RS/RA
  * You can tune the RA advertisement interval down to 1 second with `ipv6 nd ra lifetime 1`
  * This isn't too bad, but does depend on every host getting and processing the new RA 

#### 4.5.b Network Time Protocol
* 4.5.b i Master, client
  * Client config is easy, `ntp server SERVER`
  * `show ntp associations` 
    * Can take up to 5 minutes to synchornize with an upstream serer
    * Association and sync will show * in output 
  * Master config
    * Most IOS devices can be stratum 1 clock 
    * Configure `ntp master #`
      * `#` is stratum
* 4.5.b ii Authentication
  * Configure MD5 auth
  ```
  ntp authenticate
  ntp authentication-key 1234 md5 104D000A0618 7
  ntp trusted-key 1234 ! server-side 
  ntp server 1.2.3.1 key 1234 ! client-side 
  ```

#### 4.5.c DHCP on Cisco IOS
* 4.5.c i Client, server, relay
  * Client `(config-if)# ip dhcp client`
  * Server 
  ```
  ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.0.0 192.168.0.10 
  ip dhcp pool VLAN10
    network 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0
    domain-name testlab.local
    dns-server 208.67.220.22.0
    default-router 192.168.0.1 
    lease 3 ! days
  ```
  * Relay `(config-if)# ip helper-address 192.0.2.3`
* 4.5.c ii Options
  * In pool config, `option # [ ascii string | hex string | ip-address ]`
* 4.5.c iii SLAAC/DHCPv6 interaction
  * SLAAC can signal the host to get more information from DHCPv6 
  * Stateful DHCPv6 -> hosts receive addresses from DHCPv6 
  * Statless DHCPv6 -> hosts receive their addressing through RA with autconfig, and just get other stuff from DHCPv6 
  * If M and O flags = 0 (IOS default), this signals "no additional config" 
  * M flag set to 1, do stateful DHCPv6 
  * O flag set to 1, tells client additional information is available from DHCPv6 
* 4.5.c iv Stateful, stateless DHCPv6
  * Stateless
  ```
  ipv6 dhcp pool STATELESS
    dns-server 2001::1:1
    domain testlab.local
  int gi1
    ipv6 dhcp server STATELESS
    ipv6 nd other-config-flag
  ```
  * Stateful: 
  ```
  ipv6 dhcp pool STATEFUL 
    address prefix 2001:dead:beef::/64 lifetime 3
    dns-server 2001::1:1
    domain testlab.local
  int gi1
    ipv6 dhcp server STATEFUL
    ipv6 nd managed-config-flag
  ```
* 4.5.c v DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation
  * DHCPv6 out a whole giant subnet 
  * Server Config 
    * Create a pool, divide it into /56s: `ipv6 local pool BEEFPOOL 2001:BEEF::/46 56`
    * Allocate the PDs via DHCPv6 
    ```
    ipv6 dhcp pool PDPOOL
      prefix-delegation pool BEEFPOOL lifetime 3600 600
    int gi1
      ipv6 dhcp server PDPOOL
    ``` 
  * Client Config: 
  ```
  int gi1
    desc upstream
    ipv6 dhcp client pd hint ::/60 ! hint upstream what prefix side you want 
    ipv6 dhcp client pd PDNAME 
  int gi2 
    desc downstream
    ipv6 address PDNAME ::1/64
  ```

#### 4.5.d IPv4 Network Address Translation
* I hate the IOS NAT terms
  * inside local 
  * inside global
  * outside global
  * outside local 
* Make sure you said your inside/outside interface with `ip nat inside` and `ip nat outside`
* 4.5.d i Static NAT, PAT
  * Static NAT: `ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.0 204.156.135.3`
  * Static PAT `ip nat inside source static tcp 192.168.10.6 443 204.156.133.3 443`
* 4.5.d ii Dynamic NAT, PAT
  * Use a pool to NAT: 
    * `ip nat pool NAME 200.200.2.2 200.200.2.5`
    * `ip nat inside source list ACL-NAT pool NAME [ overload ]`
  * Overload an interface: `ip nat inside source list ACL-NAT int gi3 overload`
* 4.5.d iii Policy-based NAT, PAT
  * Use route-maps
  * You can do this to staitc the same IP to different IPs going out different interfaces
  ```
  route-map ISPA 
    match interface Gi3
  route-map ISPB
    match interface Gi4 
  int Gi1
    ip nat inside
    ip add 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
  int gi3
    ip nat outside
    ip add 192.0.2.3 255.255.255.0
  int gi4 
    ip nat outside
    ip address 203.0.113.5 255.255.255.0
  ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.10 192.0.2.5 route-map ISPA
  ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.10 203.0.11.35 route-map ISPB
  ```
* 4.5.d iv VRF aware NAT, PAT
  * Use to leak traffic from VRF to global  
  * Requires static routing with next-hop and global keywords 
  * NAT statements has VRF keyword in it  
  ```
  ip route VRFNAME 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <int> <ip> global  
  ip nat inside source list <#> int <interface> vrf VRFNAME overload   
  ```
* 4.5.d v IOS-XE VRF-Aware Software Infrastructure (VASI) NAT
  * Secret Tunnel!
  * IOS-XE doesn't do vrf-aware NAT with "vrf NAME" in the NAT statement 
  * Uses VASI interface pairs to NAT through the VRF 
  ```

            +--------------------------------------------------+
  ```
  * Packet enters the router in an interface beloging to VRFA 
  * Next-hop lookup sends it to vasileft1, also in VRFA 
  * This automatically gets send to vasirght1, which is in VRFB
  * When packet enters vasiright1, a forwarding lookup is done in VRFB
  * VRFB forward the packet to the egress interface 
  * TTL is decremented throughout this process
  * `vasileft1` and `vasileft2` are configured in same subnet, with `ip nat inside` and `ip nat outside` as needed 
  * NAT statement is done where the NAT happens with `vrf NAME` keyword on end of NAT 
  * Routes need to be in place to get traffic where it needs to go
